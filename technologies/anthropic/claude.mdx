### Announcing: Claude 2

Anthropic is pleased to announce the launch of Claude 2, showcasing improved performance, longer responses and accessibility via API and a new public-facing beta website, claude.ai. 

Claude 2 has demonstrated aptitude in coding, math, and reasoning, scoring 76.5% on the multiple choice section of the Bar exam, a significant improvement from the 73.0% scored by Claude 1.3. When tested against college students applying to graduate school, Claude 2 demonstrated advanced capabilities, scoring above the 90th percentile on the GRE reading and writing exams. 

The Claude 2 API for businesses is being offered at the same price as Claude 1.3. Anyone in the US and UK can start using our beta chat experience today.
