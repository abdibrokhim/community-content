Clarifai's groundbreaking technology aims to bring The World’s AI(™) to developers and data scientists around the globe. One of the first deep learning platforms since its establishment in 2013 by Matthew Zeiler, Ph.D, a distinguished expert in the realm of machine learning, the company has consistently set high benchmarks in the AI industry.  

Prior to founding Clarifai, Dr. Zeiler took the top five places in image classification at the 2013 ImageNet Challenge. By 2019, Clarifai had made such a significant impact that it was recognized as a leader in Forrester’s New Wave Computer Vision Platforms report, making it the sole startup to attain a differentiated rating. In 2022 Clarifai launched a new free service – Clarifai Community – designed to empower everyone to create, share and use The World's AI. That same year Clarifai further solidified its reputation when IDC MarketScape acknowledged it as a leader in Computer Vision AI Platforms. In 2023, Gartner named Clarifai a niche player in the Magic Quadrant for Cloud AI Developer Services for the third year in a row.

Catering to the entire AI developmental life cycle, today Clarifai provides an AI platform for unstructured image, video, text, and audio data. The platform supports data exploration, data labeling, model training, evaluation and inference, and deployment. Clarifai enables users to implement AI technology into their products via API, Mobile SDK, and/or on-premise solutions.
