## Start building with Open Interpreter

Open Interpreter empowers language models with code execution capabilities in your local environment. It supports Python, JavaScript, Shell, and more. Engage with it through a ChatGPT-like interface in your terminal by running '$ interpreter' after installation.

This provides a natural-language interface for various tasks:

* Edit photos, videos, PDFs, and more.
* Control a Chrome browser for research.
* Analyze large datasets, create plots, and perform data cleaning.

Note, code execution requires user approval.
