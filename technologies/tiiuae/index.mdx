## Key Projects and Initiatives

TII UAE is involved in various projects and initiatives aimed at driving innovation and creating a better future. Some of their key projects include:

- **Falcon LLM**: TII's flagship series of large language models, built from scratch using a custom data pipeline and distributed training library. Falcon LLM models are state-of-the-art for their size, outperforming most other models on NLP benchmarks. TII has open-sourced several Falcon LLM artifacts, including pretrained models, instruction/chat models, and the RefinedWeb dataset.

- **RefinedWeb Dataset**: A massive web dataset with stringent filtering and large-scale deduplication, enabling models trained on web data alone to match or outperform models trained on curated corpora. RefinedWeb is licensed under Apache 2.0.

- **Open Call for Proposals**: TII is calling for proposals from the global research community and SME entrepreneurs to submit use cases for Falcon LLM, promoting collaborations and driving innovation.

- **TII Falcon LLM License**: A fork of Apache 2.0, this license allows researchers and developers to freely use TII's models for research and personal purposes. For commercial use, royalties are exempted for attributable revenues under $1 million per year; otherwise, a commercial agreement with TII is required.
