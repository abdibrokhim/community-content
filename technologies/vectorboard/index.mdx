# ðŸ’› Vectorboard

Vectorboard is an open-source framework for optimizing and evaluating embedding and retrieval-based machine learning models, particularly those built around RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

RAG is a methodology that enhances machine learning models by combining generative and retrieval-based aspects.

**Importance of Good Embeddings**
Good embeddings are vital for the successful execution of RAG applications. They serve as the basis for retrieving contextually relevant information.

## How Vectorboard Helps

Vectorboard simplifies the complex task of optimizing these embeddings by trying different hyperparameters (chunk size, overlap, splitting function, embedding algorithm, etc,) in a structured framework.

In the end, Vectorboard provides you with a Results Dashboard that allows you to compare the performance of different embeddings and hyperparameters, ran on your own data.
