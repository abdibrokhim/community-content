## How Does The AutoGPT Work?

AutoGPTs typically utilize a language model such as [GPT-4](https://lablab.ai/tech/openai/gpt4) at its core AI engine. When given command for a task, it can create a plan to accomplish the goal, prompting GPT-4 to help at each step. It leverages memory, internet access, and text generation to iteratively make progress until the task is complete.

AutoGPT continuously evaluates the quality of its work. If an output does not meet a certain threshold, it will retry and reformulate its approach. This autonomous loop allows it to improve with experience.

### What can an AutoGPT do?

As all the AI agents, AutoGPT can perform sequences of goal oriented actions through language input and thus typically involve LLMs such as GPT-4. For instance:

* Website creation
* Writing articles and blogs
* Marketing strategy development
* Product reviews and recommendations
* Conversational interface design
* Software prototyping and development
* Creative work like logos and graphics

And much more! The open-ended nature of AutoGPT allows for expanding capabilities as developers build on top of it.
