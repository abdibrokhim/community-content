# Stable Dreamfusion

Stable-Dreamfusion is an avant-garde PyTorch implementation that seamlessly integrates text-to-3D modeling by synergizing the Stable Diffusion text-to-2D model with Dreamfusion technology.

Enabling the translation of textual content into rich 3D visuals, this cutting-edge model leverages a latent diffusion approach and a multi-resolution grid encoder to offer rapid rendering. While it offers groundbreaking potential in fields like 3D gaming, virtual reality, and film production, it's important to note that the current version contains differences from the original paper, resulting in varying generation quality.

With ongoing development and exciting recent support for Perp-Neg, Stable-Dreamfusion stands as a promising frontier in 3D AI technologies.
