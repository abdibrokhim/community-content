# OpenAI GPT-3.5

GPT-3.5 is a set of models that improve on GPT-3 and can understand as well as generate natural language or code. It is an autoregressive language model (LLM) from [OpenAI](https://lablab.ai/tech/openai) that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. It is a fine-tuned version of GPT-3, the third-generation language prediction model in the GPT series created by OpenAI. GPT-3.5 has garnered significant attention and acclaim for its unparalleled ability to understand and generate human-like text. With an astounding 175 billion parameters at its disposal, GPT-3.5 stands as one of the most expansive and powerful language models ever constructed at the time of its release.

GPT-3.5's exceptional performance is not only limited to its sheer size but also stems from its highly refined architecture. Harnessing the power of deep learning, GPT-3.5 delivers consistently accurate and relevant results, elevating the standard for language models and establishing itself as a trailblazer in the field of artificial intelligence.
