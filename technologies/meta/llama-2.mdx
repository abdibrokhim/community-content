## Features of Llama 2

Llama 2 comes with significant improvements over Llama 1:
1. Increased Training on Tokens: Llama 2 is trained on 40% more tokens, promising to deliver enhanced language understanding capabilities.
2. Longer Context Length: With a longer context length of 4k tokens, Llama 2 is expected to maintain better context in prolonged conversations.
3. Fine-Tuning for Dialogues: The versions of Llama 2 that are fine-tuned (Labelled Llama 2-Chat) are aimed at being optimized for dialogue applications using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).

## Accessing and Using Llama 2

### Llama 2 Deployment

For an efficient deployment of Llama 2:
- For the 7B models, "GPU [medium] - 1x Nvidia A10G" could be the choice.
- For the 13B models, "GPU [xlarge] - 1x Nvidia A100" can be an option.
- For the 70B models, "GPU [xxxlarge] - 8x Nvidia A100" might be suitable.

These deployments might be available on platforms like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

## Responsible Use of Llama 2

Although the use of Llama 2 is encouraged, it's crucial to follow the guidelines for responsible use. Red-teaming exercises might be utilized along with a transparency schematic, and responsible use guide and an acceptable use policy might also be provided to ensure secure and acceptable use of Llama 2. Participation in the Open Innovation AI Research Community and Llama Impact Challenge could be valuable for feedback and proposing improvements.

## Conclusion

Llama 2, poised as the successor of the acclaimed Llama 1, signifies a new horizon in the landscape of large language models. The vast potential it holds is eagerly anticipated and it is hoped the global AI community will bring forth innovative and advantageous applications using Llama 2.
