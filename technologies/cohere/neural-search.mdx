# Cohere Neural Search
Language models give computers the ability to search by meaning and go beyond searching by matching keywords. This capability is called semantic search.

Popular use case of semantic search is building a next generation web search engine. Impressive, but the applications of semantic search go beyond that! They can empower a private search engine for internal documents or records. They can be used to power features like StackOverflow's "similar questions" feature. And you can build many more things with it.

Semantic search is the most successful with text sources where the answer to a query is likely to be in a single, concrete paragraph, such as technical documentation or wikis which are organized as a list of instructions or facts.

### Cohere Multilingual Semantic Search
Text embeddings are a central component in machine language understanding. They are numeric representations of text (be it a document, an email, or even a sentence). An embedding model translates text into a list of numbers that capture its meaning. A multilingual embedding model is able to do that well for many languages.

* [This video](https://youtu.be/45mF81IosK4) demonstrates Cohere's multilingual embedding model, and its ability to represent many languages.
