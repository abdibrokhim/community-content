# SuperAGI

SuperAGI is a dev-first, open-source autonomous AI agent framework - Enabling developers to build, manage & run useful autonomous agents quickly and reliably. Users can extend Agent capabilities with tools such as GitHub, Jira, Slack, Twitter, etc., and also run multiple agents concurrently.

SuperAGI also provides users with a GUI to easily configure and monitor their agents. Users can access organization, run, and user-level metrics via the Agent Performance Monitoring (APM) dashboard to get actionable insights about improving their agents.
