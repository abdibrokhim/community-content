## ðŸ”¥ There is no doubt that AI is one of the hottest topics in the tech world right now and the AI community is one of the most rapidly growing ones. 

Also AI Hackathons are getting more and more popular, due to a great way to quickly incubate ideas in such a swift environment. Creating a prototype with assistance of mentors, with like-minded people from all around the world seems like a great opportunity to change your career. Either you work with Cohere, Whisper or Stable Diffusion - we got you covered and you can see upcoming Hackathons on our [event page](https://lablab.ai/event). 

AI startups will be taking over the tech industry and you can read more about it in NewNativeâ€™s state of the art [report.](https://newnative.ai/news/the-ai-economy-and-future-of-ai-natives) Generative AI is already modernizing the creative industry, but what about other industries? And does that mean that every developer needs to know AI?

### The short answer is: No.

Actually, every developer can learn AI. For example with usage of our[ tutorials](https://lablab.ai/t). However, it would behoove every developer to be aware of AI and its potential implications for the future of software development.

## âœ¨ With that said, here are five reasons why every developer should at least have a basic understanding of AI: 

### To better understand the user.
As software developers, we try to better understand the user and what they want from our applications. AI can help us take that understanding to the next level by providing insights we wouldn't otherwise have.

### To build more intelligent applications. 
By understanding AI, we can start to build applications that are smarter and more efficient. For example, we can use AI to help automate tasks or make valuable suggestions based on their behavior. 

### To stay ahead of the curve. 
AI is something that is only going to become more prevalent in the years to come. As developers, we need to stay ahead of the curve and be prepared for when AI starts to have a more significant impact on our industry. 

### To improve our own skills.
Understanding AI can help us improve our own skills as developers. For example, we can learn new ways to code or optimize our applications. 

### To have fun.
Let's face it, AI is just plain cool. By understanding AI, we can have a lot of fun experimenting with it and seeing what it can do. And we can create tools which donâ€™t exist and are not clones of other apps, as the technology is pretty new. See examples of amazing apps developers created in our [Stable Diffusion](https://lablab.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-hackathon-winner-announcement) AI Hackathons. 

Well, if you're a developer, it's time to start learning about AI! And one of the best ways to do that is by attending AI hackathons. You will have the opportunity to learn from the brightest minds in the field and experiment with AI in a collaborative environment of like-minded people so don;t waste more time.
