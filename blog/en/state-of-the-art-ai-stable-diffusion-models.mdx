## What are Stable Diffusion models?

Latent diffusion models (LDMs) are a type of image generation technique that work by iteratively "de-noising" data in a latent representation space, and then decoding the representation into a full image. This is in contrast to other popular image synthesis methods such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and the auto-regressive technique used by DALL-E. 

The Stable Diffusion model is created by a collaboration between engineers and researchers from [CompVis](https://huggingface.co/CompVis), [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/), and [LAION](https://laion.ai/) and released under a [Creative ML OpenRAIL-M](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CompVis/stable-diffusion-license) license, which means that it can be used for commercial and non-commercial purposes. The release of this file is the culmination of many hours of collective effort to compress the visual information of humanity into a few gigabytes. 

Furthermore, the model also supports image-to-image style transfer, as well as upscaling and generating images from a simple sketch. Included is also an AI-based Safety Classifier, which understands concepts and other factors in generations to remove outputs that may not be desired by the model user.

### Where can Stable Diffusion Models be used and why?

Stable Diffusion is a latent diffusion model that is capable of generating detailed images from text descriptions. It can also be used for tasks such as inpainting, outpainting, text-to-image and image-to-image translations.

Due to its powerful ability to generate images based on different types of prompts (text, image, etc.) actually only our imagination limits us where this tool can be used. It can fasten or enhance our ability to create more engaging content for our customers or users in general. Even if you’re a creative who sucks with a creative block you can use generated images to get inspired and overcome the stagnation. We encourage you to do a unique art with usage of Stable Diffusion models or first drafts for your artistic (or everyday) journey.

## Examples of technologies that use Stable Diffusion models

Already there are dozens of tools using Stable Diffusion models. We want to inspire you and show how amazing aps have been created during our Hackathons, so we gathered them in one place!

## So how can I start using Stable Diffusion models?

<Img src="https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/f51e5c22-d375-4941-632a-dfa5942b3f00/full" alt="a boy with laptop under the tree" />

If you don't know how to adopt them, we recommend you to first of all visit our [Stable Diffusion tutorials](https://lablab.ai/tech/stable-diffusion). 

From that place the journey is really simple, as you already know how such models can be used, so it’s time for practice. And where better to test your skills than during 3 or 7 days Hackathons? With a group of like-minded people and with assistance of mentors? I can’t come up with a better place, so start (or improve) your AI journey with New Year’s resolutions and with lablab.ai’s [AI Hackathons](https://lablab.ai/event)!
