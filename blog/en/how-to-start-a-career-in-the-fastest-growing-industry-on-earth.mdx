AI is the number one growth industry on Earth and will stay that way for the coming decade. 

If you are considering a career change, AI is the best choice.

There is an opportunity to make this change happen in a few days. All you need to do is spend the weekend working together with like-minded people on 18/11/2022 during Cohere Hackathon, brought to you by lablab.ai. 

## ü§ù Meet Cohere

Start with Cohere Tutorials and explore the coding and how-to guides available on our website to help you get started and learn to build with Cohere artificial intelligence technology

## üí° Try our tutorials:

### [Text embedder with Cohere](https://lablab.ai/t/cohere-text-embedder)
Text embedding is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. Neural networks are a widely used and effective method for creating text embeddings. Text embeddings can be used for tasks such as text classification, text similarity, and text clustering.

### [Build a product description generator API with cohere](https://lablab.ai/t/cohere-product-description-generator)
In this tutorial, you will build your own product description generator API with Cohere. You can use this API to generate product descriptions for your own products. This tutorial is suitable for everyone who have some basic knowledge of Javascript/NodeJS.

### [Text classifier with Cohere](https://lablab.ai/t/cohere-text-classifier)
Cohere models can be used not only to generate the text but also for classification. In this tutorial, you will be able to classify a short text, with a small dataset.

Then make sure to work with like-minded people during the upcoming Cohere Thanksgiving AI Hackathon! A Hackathon to be thankful for!

## üõ†Ô∏è Check out what other people have built during the previous Cohere Hackathons.

### Brain Tumor Classification
We have developed a Brain tumor classification app that helps doctors with the diagnosis. With this tool insurance and public health systems can launch massive brain tumor detection campaigns and save much time with the diagnosis, which will help in the early detection of this deadly disease.

### Research Paper Clustering
The goal is to provide an interactive tool for visualizing research papers in a 2D map where the papers are placed on the map based on some vector embedding of the summary. The papers that are similar to each other will cluster together. This will allow researchers to identify papers that have similar concepts and even allow users to look at concepts from different fields that are applicable in their own field.

### Fake News Detector
The proposed solution alongside my teammates is to build a Fake News Detection Application meant to limit the propaganda effect. With the use of Node.js and GPT-3 trained model Davinci, we gave birth to our CrewBot.
