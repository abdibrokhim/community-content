## Introducing Anthropic Claude: Revolutionizing the AI Assistant Landscape

[Anthropic](https://lablab.ai/tech/anthropic/claude) Claude is a cutting-edge AI assistant, developed from Anthropic's extensive research into creating beneficial, trustworthy, and non-harmful AI systems. All users and businesses using Anthropic Claude stated that they tested other AI assistants and decided to go with Claude, due to its less harmful replies and the nature of the interaction which felt like a natural conversation, with detailed and easily understood answers. So far in order to use it you have to join the waitlist, but thanks to the collaboration of lablab.ai and Antrophic we have a unique solution to our community - but we will speak more about it later on in the article!

Ok, but what does differ Anthropic Claude from other LLMs (Large Language Models)? How is it different from ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Cohere?

## Anthropic vs other AI assistants.

<Img src="https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/58e1bbdb-8743-4ac8-984e-5cda72217500/full" alt="a human at the waterfall" />

The main advantage of Claude lies in the unique conversational experience and the safety it provides, as previously mentioned. As the biggest problem today is to produce ethical and safe AI, Antrophic’s main goal was to build LLM with safety at its core and with industry-leading security practices. It is an AI company with ethics as a core principle.

But some others might say, that something is more important than the social impact. AI can have on everyday life and our human, and that would be efficiency. And if we focus on that, we will see that Anthropic Claude is out beating every other LLM today. It offers a **100 000 tokens context window**. 

But what does it mean? And how does this change the market?

### What is a context window?

A context window is the extent of text that a language model can simultaneously process and store. Typically measured in tokens, which approximately represent individual words, the context window indicates the quantity of information from preceding inputs that the model can utilize for generating its output. For instance, should a model possess a context window comprising 2048 tokens, it would be able to harness the latest 2048 tokens of text to produce its response.

The context window for Anthropic Claude was 9k and has been expanded to 100k, which is around 75 000 words! The average person can read 100k tokens worth of text in around 5h. This means you can give any context for Anthropic Claude - hundred of pages long book or business data of your company and many many more and let it analyze it in less than a minute and then have tons of interactions around it. 

To compare the scale - ChatGPT can preserve context up to 4 096 tokens. GPT-4 has an 8 000 and 32 000 token limits. Many open-source models are limited to 2 048 tokens.

Ok, we know about context and input, let’s see the output.

The same prompt for every interaction: 

```

### ChatGPT

```

Building an AI app can be an exciting and potentially lucrative idea, even for people without a tech background. However, it's important to consider several factors before diving into such a venture. Here are some points to consider:

1. Learning curve: Developing an AI app typically requires a good understanding of programming, algorithms, and machine learning concepts. If you don't have a tech background, you may need to invest time and effort in learning these skills. There are various online resources, courses, and tutorials available to help you get started.
2. Team collaboration: Developing a complex AI app often involves collaboration with professionals who have expertise in AI and software development. Consider building a team or partnering with individuals who have the necessary technical skills to complement your domain expertise.
3. Cost and resources: Building an AI app can involve significant costs. Apart from the development itself, you may need to invest in computational resources, cloud services, and data acquisition. Assess your financial situation and determine if you have the necessary resources or if you need to seek funding or investment.
4. Market research and viability: Conduct thorough market research to identify potential customers, understand their needs, and assess the viability of your app idea. Evaluate the competition and determine how your app can offer unique value or address existing gaps.
5. User experience and design: Consider the user experience and design aspects of your app. It's crucial to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface that provides value to users. If you lack design skills, you may need to collaborate with a designer to ensure a polished product.
6. Legal and ethical considerations: Be aware of legal and ethical considerations related to AI applications, such as data privacy, security, and potential biases. Familiarize yourself with relevant regulations and ensure your app adheres to best practices.
7. Long-term maintenance and updates: Building an AI app is not a one-time endeavor. You will likely need to continually update and maintain the app to ensure it remains functional, secure, and up-to-date with technological advancements.

While building an AI app without a tech background is challenging, it is not impossible. Many successful entrepreneurs have started with limited technical knowledge but have managed to build successful ventures by collaborating with the right people and continuously learning along the way. Consider partnering with or hiring technical experts to fill any knowledge gaps and increase your chances of success.

Building an AI app in 2023 could be an idea worth considering for non-technical people, but there are some things to keep in mind:

 Pros:

• AI technologies are becoming more accessible. There are many open source libraries and cloud services that make it easier to implement AI without a strong technical background. Things like pre-trained models, drag and drop interfaces, and low/no-code tools are making AI more user-friendly.

• The demand for AI skills and apps is growing. Being able to build an AI-powered app could be a useful skill and open up opportunities.

• You can start simple and iterate. You don't need to build extremely complex AI to start. You can focus on simple applications of natural language, computer vision, etc. and build from there.

 Cons:

• You still need some technical skills. While the barriers are lowering, building an AI app still requires skills like data analysis, API usage, and software development basics. The learning curve may be steep for total beginners.

• AI projects can be complex. Managing data, models, training, and performance optimization requires time and persistence. It may be frustrating without experience. 

• The market is competitive. There are many AI apps and services out there already, so coming up with an idea that provides value could be challenging without a technical background to identify unique opportunities.

• Regulations and ethics are challenging to navigate. Those building AI systems need to ensure they are compliant, unbiased, and safe. This requires knowledge around AI ethics and regulations that would take time to develop.

So in summary, building an AI app in 2023 is within reach for non-technical people, especially with a learn-as-you-go mindset. However, you need to go in with realistic expectations about the challenges involved and be willing to develop some new technical and AI-specific skills to be successful. With time and persistence, it is possible, but not easy, especially for total beginners.
