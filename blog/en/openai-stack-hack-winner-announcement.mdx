## Biggest lablab.ai’s AI Hackathon is over!

The biggest AI Hackathon (so far!) organized by lablab.ai is over. During a 7 day event a huge number of people from all around the world united to build something mesmerizing, something which might change the future, something that will solve the world's problems with the help of AI.

All of the teams were building using the newest cutting edge AI technologies, such as Whisper, GPT-3, DALL-E 2, Codex, ChatGPT and more and the results are pretty amazing!

We saw almost 100 projects which were dedicated to changing the health industry, business, creative and many many more. AI technology is in and we encourage everyone to embrace it.


## Let’s look at the numbers!

## OpenAI Stack Hack is over but there is more to come!

<Img src="https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/d10c5149-0f93-4121-d4d7-67cc2c62c600/full" alt="happy people" />

We love to see that the community of innovators, builders and creators is still growing. We are amazed by the complexity level of the submitted projects and the still expanding interest in AI technology. We believe that every 7315 participants is already a winner, as they know what is the technology of the future! We love the progress, because during [openai codex hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-gpt3-codex-dalle2-hackathon) only third of the people worldwide identified the technology! And during [openai gym hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/reinforcement-learning-openai-gym) the amount od participants was also much smaller.

Also our community took our breath away, as we got familiar with all of the submitted projects and we saw so many projects that meet the most important value for lablab.ai, which is using AI to solve problems. We don’t support the overproduction of different apps clones. We value innovation and the impact it will have on users everyday live. We want to shape the world, create trends - not to be copycats. And we want to thank every community member for making the world a better place.

We encourage you to discover all AI applications created by our participants during this and all of our past Hackathons to get inspired and see how other people are creating something amazing!

But the journey doesn't end here. Feel invited to our next AI Hackathons and be a part of the happening AI revolution.

Join our next[ AI Hackathons](https://lablab.ai/event), win amazing prizes, learn and grow.
