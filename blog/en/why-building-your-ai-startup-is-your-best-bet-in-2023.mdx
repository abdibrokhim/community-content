## AI in the last 6 months

With the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI, AI broke into the mainstream and is creating as many emotions as any technology didn’t before. On the one hand, we have people who are adopting the newest technology - by contributing their time and knowledge in creating new tools based on existing models, adopting existing LLM into their app or just improving their everyday work performance by usage of the AI-based technology. And we have a second group of people, who are not adopting AI in their everyday life. Despite using it unconsciously with social media algorithms or streaming platform suggestions and many, many more - they are still against it. 

The second group does not understand one thing - The AI revolution is already happening and we cannot go back from it. In the same way, we can’t go back to hunter-gatherer culture and even if we romanticize living in the wild, outside the society, we will not achieve it. Maybe a small group of people can do so, but we, as over 8 billion people, can’t. I think that attitude is fear-driven - in literature and movies we have been fed the vision of AI and robots destroying humankind. And as people don't understand how LLM work, they will repeat slogans like AI will replace them or someone needs to regulate the usage of it. 

We saw a breakthrough in the last 6 months - GPT-4 build in Edge browser, Google, Amazon, and Apple investing in AI technology, and many, many more. We saw babyAGI and AutonomusGPT and already emerging [AutoGPT app](https://lablab.ai/tech/autogpt)! 

And we know one - AI is here to stay, so either you embrace it and benefit from it, or you will have to adapt to it when you will have no choice. But as you’re reading it it means, you understand what’s going on and you want to change the future, so let’s don’t waste more time!


## Why should my startup use AI technology?

"Why should my startup use AI technology?" - It's a question every entrepreneur should be asking. Artificial Intelligence is no longer a futuristic concept; it's an essential component of modern business strategy. It is already proven it can increase the work efficiency and happiness of people using it. Also, it allows its user to achieve things that would be more time-consuming or just impossible due to a lack of expertise in a certain field. Right now we see emerging AI-based technologies every week which are changing the world as we know it, and it’s not only by big corporations but by startup entrepreneurs and Open Source lovers. AI is the democratized technology and we should celebrate it and delve into it!

And here's why you should embrace AI technology in your startup journey:


### Efficiency & Automation 

AI can help automate mundane tasks, increasing productivity and allowing your team to focus on more strategic, creative, and value-added tasks.


### Data-Driven Decisions

 AI analyzes complex datasets, providing valuable insights and enabling data-driven decision-making, ensuring your startup is always one step ahead of the competition.


### Personalization & Customer Engagement: 

Leveraging AI, your startup can offer personalized experiences to customers, create targeted marketing campaigns, and enhance customer retention.


### Innovation & Competitive Advantage

AI can uncover new opportunities and streamline processes, giving your startup the edge to outperform competitors and stay ahead of the curve.


### Cost Savings & Scalability

As AI systems become smarter and more efficient, they can help reduce costs and enable rapid growth, positioning your startup for long-term success.


## Ok, I Have an AI Startup Idea, What Now?

As we’ve been talking about since the first day of lablab.ai - the best way to create an AI-based startup is to find a problem you are facing, or someone from your closed circle, and build an AI-driven solution to it. That’s the best way. You will already have first users/consumers - people who are facing the same problem and couldn’t overcome it before your technology has been created. And from that point sky is the limit. You can add improve your product to reach wider user base or use the knowledge you had and use it for solving another world’s problem.

That’s the way we promote in lablab.ai - changing the world with the power of AI!

So if you're convinced that building an AI startup is the way to go, here are some steps to help you get started:


### Identify a problem

 Find a problem that AI can help solve more efficiently than current methods. Consider your industry knowledge, interests, and expertise to pinpoint an area where you can make a difference.


### Learn the necessary skills

If you don't have a background in data science or AI, consider taking courses or attending workshops to familiarize yourself with the technology.


### Assemble a team

Building an AI startup requires a diverse set of skills, including expertise in data science, programming, and business strategy. Bring together a team that shares your vision and can contribute to your startup's success.


### Develop a prototype

Create a proof-of-concept to test your idea and gather feedback from potential users. This will help you refine your product and determine whether it's viable.


### Seek funding

To scale and grow your AI startup, you'll likely need funding. Research grants, pitch competitions, and venture capital firms that specialize in AI investments to secure the necessary funds.


### Iterate and grow

As with any startup, be prepared to iterate and adapt your product based on user feedback and market trends.
