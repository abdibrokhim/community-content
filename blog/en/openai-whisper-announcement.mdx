## Whisper from OpenAI - voice recognition system that changes the rules of the game
OpenAI has just announced an amazing new development in the world of AI - the release of Whisper, a neural net designed for English speech recognition.

The model was trained for 680,000 hours (that's about 77 years!) that is said to be so it has a high level of robustness and accuracy, approaching human level performance.

This is a huge step forward in the field of AI and has the potential to change the way many businesses operate.

There are lots of applications for voice recognition technology, including customer service, virtual assistants, and hands-free controls. This technology is often used in call centers, where it can be used to route calls or transcribe customer interactions.

## Generative AI Model with unique Whispering Approach
The new Whisper system from OpenAI could significantly improve the accuracy of these apps, making them much more reliable. This development is also significant for businesses that are developing virtual assistants.

These systems often use voice recognition to interact with users and perform tasks. With the release of Whisper, these systems can now be developed with the goal of achieving human level accuracy. This could lead to more natural and efficient interactions with users.

Overall, the release of Whisper from OpenAI is a huge development in the field of voice recognition. This system has the potential to grow businesses that rely on this technology in a really positive way.Â 

Among other things, with the help of Whisper model you can create your own AI product or integrate it with other AI tools.

You can build with Whisper by taking part in the Whisper OpenAI Hackathon. With access to the latest AI tools, mentoring and support from the top people in AI, in 48 hours you can build your AI product (and even get support if you want to continue working on it). It's not too late to join the Hackathon, which takes place October 14-17.

We can't wait to see how it will be used in the future!
