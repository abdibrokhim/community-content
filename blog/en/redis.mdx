**[New Native](https://newnative.ai/) and [Redis](https://redis.com/) partner to Accelerate Generative AI Innovation throughout the lablab.ai community. lablab.ai, the leading platform for generative AI, is thrilled to announce a new collaboration with Redis, the leading provider of enterprise-class solutions for vector search, data storage, and ML feature workloads.**  
 
Redis is a real-time data platform with its blazing-fast vector database that provides additional capabilities to the technologies already present on the platform such as Cohere, StabilityAI, AI21, and OpenAI tech stacks. 

## New range of capabilities

Redis provides low-latency data access, flexible data structures, and emerging capabilities like Vector Search that augment solutions built with LLM and GenAI technologies. We can't wait to see how the lablab community integrates [RediSearch](https://github.com/RediSearch/RediSearch), [RedisJson](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON), and other [Redis modules](https://redis.io/resources/modules/) while building the next generation of AI-Native software solutions.  
 
This partnership is the latest in a series of collaborations for Lablab, helping to provide the best possible ai-native tech stack for users.  
 
> We're excited to work with Redis to empower the lablab community to create even more amazing projects
 
> This partnership is a great opportunity to connect our users with the best technology on the market.  

-- said NN founders Mathias, Pawel & Simon.  

 
> Vector databases are playing an important role for vector search and retrieval, and are increasingly being used for querying texts and images for generative AI applications

> With Redis Vector Similarity Search, developers are turning to technologies they already know to build AI apps, and we are thrilled to be partnering with lablab to unleash this innovation.  This partnership is a step towards the use of efficient vector databases with state of the art AI transformers.
 
-- said Taimur Rashid, Chief Business Officer at Redis

lablab and Redis are looking forward to a successful partnership in the following months and years to come.

## How to get started

Redis is fully available to lablab.ai users through [Side Quests](https://lablab.ai/side-quests) that are bonus hackathon challenges that you can choose to take on. In this way, you can explore additional technologies, tools, or platforms to include in your project, as well as compete for extra prizes. See the [Redis Tech Page](https://lablab.ai/tech/redis) for more resources!

## About Redis & Lablab
 
### Redis

[Redis](https://redis.com/) is an open-source, in-memory data store that provides access to mutable data structures via a set of commands. It is also a real-time data platform that functions as a blazing-fast vector database, ML feature store, and data serving layer across a variety of workloads. Redis offers high performance and scalability, making it a popular choice for use in web applications and other use cases that require fast data access.

### lablab 

[lablab.ai](https://lablab.ai/) is a community of Makers, building with state-of-the-art, modern Artificial Intelligence. Lablab.ai is an initiative designed to support and stimulate the modern artificial intelligence ecosystem and the innovators behind it. Our collaborative approach with leading AI labs, Commercial and Open source initiatives & technology companies helps unlock the state-of-the-art AI technologies and infrastructure
