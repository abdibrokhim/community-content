The recent ElevenLabs Hackathon hosted on lablab.ai was an exciting event that brought together a global community of over 2,660 coders, engineers, designers, and voice AI enthusiasts.

The ambitious goal? To collaboratively push the boundaries of what's possible with voice technology and AI.

With 140 incredibly inventive [prototype submissions](https://lablab.ai/apps/tech/elevenlabs), 374 project teams formed, and participants from many countries, the intensive 3-day hackathon demonstrated the tremendous energy, creativity, and potential of the voice AI community.

## The Hackathon Experience: Learning, Building, and Creating Together

For both veteran coders and enthusiastic beginners alike, hackathons like this provide a valuable hands-on learning experience. Participants not only get access to cutting-edge tools, but also get to connect with fellow builders and innovators.

Over the 4 packed days of the event, attendees participated in educational sessions led by both lablab.ai & ElevenLabs experts to get up to speed on how to leverage generative voice AI models. Equipped with this knowledge, they then formed teams and spent the bulk of the time collaboratively designing, architecting, and building out their unique project ideas.

Both individual participants and teams faced the exhilarating challenge of taking their ideas from conception to functional prototype in just 96 hours. The fast-paced and intensive building process encouraged creative problem-solving as developers integrated ElevenLabs' voice AI into the video and audio content and content creation process for their innovations.

The hands-on, collaborative setting facilitated learning not just from the educational sessions, but also from each other. Teams brainstormed solutions, provided feedback, and exchanged tips on best practices for voice AI implementation. Developers with more experience mentored newcomers, providing guidance and advice.

This combination of expert-led guidance and peer-to-peer collaboration led to incredible results and allowed participants to make the most of accessing ElevenLabs' cutting-edge natural voice technology. They emerged from the event newly-equipped with valuable hands-on experience in applied voice AI development.

## Accessing the Latest Advances in Voice AI

A key benefit of the hackathon was providing access to ElevenLabs' newest generative voice AI models, training videos and tools.|

Participants got to work hands-on with technologies including:

**Speech Synthesis**

ElevenLabs' Speech Synthesis provides extremely high-quality and more natural sounding voice and text-to-speech voice generation and capabilities. Developers could leverage it for text to speech and text to speech to create voiceovers and add lifelike voice narration and text to speech to their projects.

Key features include:
  - Generating audio in a growing number of languages and accents
  - Controlling pace, tone, style, and emotional expression
  - Maintaining contextual awareness for more natural delivery
  - Outputting to common audio formats

**VoiceLab**

VoiceLab is an AI voice  generator that enables creators to clone their own voice or design an AI voice generation and fully customized synthetic voices from scratch using generative AI. Hackathon coders used this tool to bring voice AI generation, generated voice and unique voices to life in their prototypes.
With VoiceLab you can:
  - Clone a voice with just a few minutes of sample audio
  - Tweak pitch, speed, accent, tone, and other vocal qualities
  - Generate completely new voices tailored to your needs
  - Build diverse casts of characters for content

Accessing these powerful developer tools and being able to integrate them into working prototypes provided valuable hands-on learning and feedback opportunities. Testing the latest advancements allowed participants to push voice AI forward.

## Prizes and Rewards for Top Projects

In addition to the hackathon prizes, the ElevenLabs hackathon offered various benefits to support users in exploring and building with their own voice and AI platform:

**Community Forum**

Participants had access to the both lablab.ai and ElevenLabs members to ask questions, troubleshoot issues, and connect with fellow builders. Knowledge sharing accelerates innovation.

**Technical Tutorials**

Both lablab.ai & ElevenLabs provided a library of [technical tutorials](https://lablab.ai/t/tech/elevenlabs), youtube videos, documentation, code samples, and guides to help video and audio content and creators skill up on voice AI applications.

These initiatives help lower barriers and provide on-ramps for students, academics, researchers, and developers looking to push voice technology forward.

## Fostering Community, Collaboration, and Innovation
