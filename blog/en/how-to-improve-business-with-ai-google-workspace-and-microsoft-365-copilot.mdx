## Why Google and Microsoft are interested in AI tools?

After the launch of ChatGPT nothing will be the same - the AI revolution is here and funds invested by tech giants into the newest technology only prove that. 

Over 6 months ago we entered a new era of technological innovation, where artificial intelligence (AI) takes center stage in reshaping the landscape of how we work, live, and interact with the world. Two tech giants, Google and Microsoft, are aware of AI’s potential to revolutionize the modern workplace and want to become leaders in that shift. But how exactly are performing AI-fueled Google Workspace and Microsoft Copilot?

If you had any basic ideas for an app like an AI email assistant to help you write them - tech giants incorporated them in their apps for free. So the race for innovation is on and the winner will take it all! Maybe you should find a unique idea and build a solution for it during [Hackathon Artificial Intelligence](https://lablab.ai/event)?

We are almost a month after the release date - let’s see what was promised and what we got.


### Introducing Google Workplace with AI

Google Workspace (formerly known as G Suite) is a suite of cloud-based collaboration work base tools that since the day of its launch has been a game-changer for businesses worldwide. As Google wanted to be a leader in the AI revolution, it needed to step up its game. That’s why it decided to incorporate AI capabilities into its platform. Everything is to be able to compete with any pretendant, it doesn’t matter if it is Microsoft, Amazon, or even Bloomberg. And we, the users are of course profiting from that innovations. 

So in Google Workplace, we already could use two AI-driven features - Smart Compose and Smart Reply, which assisted users in improving their email game or enhancing their writing by utilizing auto-suggesting options to offer grammar and language suggestions, ensuring that your documents are polished and professional. But right now Google wants to go even further!

They [introduced](https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/generative-ai) a closed beta for USA-based testers of their new AI feature. A powerful tool to help you start your creative writing or improve your outbound emails. It will have text-to-text features, like writing certain content based on a prompt given. It will help users to get started and allow them to have their first draft to improve. Also, it will have a rewriting option in order to improve the written content or to change its tone to a more formal one. And what’s more, it will be able to change the meeting notes into an email.

Really cool tool, but for now we have to wait to test it ourselves.


### How Microsoft 365 Copilot can help you in everyday tasks?

Microsoft Copilot is a recently unveiled AI-powered coding assistant that aims to revolutionize the software development process. Developers using Github Copilot improved their performance by over [70%](https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/). That’s why two days after Google, Microsoft announced their new (and better than Google’s) AI features in their Microsoft 365 suite. Everything to increase the creative potential in your everyday work and make all of the repetitive and boring tasks do AI for you.

All of the features introduced for Microsoft 365 Copilot are more advanced than the ones announced by Google. They also have built-in text-to-text generators to improve writing your emails or job offers etc. But if you are among millions of people who already try [chatGPT](https://lablab.ai/tech/openai/chatgpt) you know the capabilities of this LLM, but regarding the one that Google wants to present - well, we don’t.

But what’s really unique about the new Microsoft 365 copilot is that it will be able to generate images, charts, and even animations! You will just basically give a prompt to the assistant and it will insert the visual part in your presentations, emails, and many more. Every tool from Microsoft suite is getting a boost and a major one. Again Microsoft outcompetes Google on the level of innovation.

Oh, and it will have a Business Chat so a personal assistant for every employee of your company. A huge boost to productivity, creativity, and overall fun in performing tasks.

The only problem is that it is in closed beta as well and we cannot test it. As we will have access, for sure we will give you feedback on if it is as innovative as it seems today.


## Is there a chance of competing against tech giants?

For sure! As you can see, the updates offered in Google’s and Microsoft’s suites are the first things that come to your mind if you are introduced to the capabilities of LLM. They are a straightforward improvement in a business's everyday work and it was obvious that at some point there will be part of mainstream technology.

But this is a good thing. Why? Well, first of all, it means that people will adopt the technology and get more familiar with it. The pool of consumers of AI technology is growing and the trend will continue to do so. And there’s a place for you in it. Let me explain.

We at lablab.ai are supporting innovators, creators, and builders from all around the world.
