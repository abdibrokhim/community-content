Generative AI Hackathon has come to an end and the results are in! With over 1400 participants, 127 teams and 27 submitted amazing projects, the lablab.ai team is proud to announce the winners of the Generative AI Hackathon!


### 🎉 First place:


**Phoeniks team for their project “Baith al suroor”** 🥇

This Artificial Intelligence powered solution uses the power of Cohere’s language Command model to generate descriptions of desired designs and the Stable Diffusion generative model to create relevant images and transitional videos. 

Congratulations to the team! And if you want to know more about Phoeniks’s project [visit the submission page](https://lablab.ai/event/undefined/phoeniks/Baith%20al%20suroor).

**A tie between two teams: Mental Health AI and SundarAI** 🥈 

Mental Health AI’s project [“I Rene”](https://lablab.ai/event/generative-ai-hackathon/Mental%20Health%20AI/i-rene) uses Cohere’s Conversant AI tool to provide CBT for users, while SundarAI’s project [“vidSummarizer”](https://lablab.ai/event/generative-ai-hackathon/vidsummarizer/vidsummarizer) helps users to analyze sentiment & summarize audio & video files into simple text within seconds, making them more accessible to those with hearing disabilities!
