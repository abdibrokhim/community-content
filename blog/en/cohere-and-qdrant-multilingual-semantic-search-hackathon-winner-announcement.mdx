## First Cohere and Qdrant is over!

First AI hackathon, where participants had to use both Cohere and Qdrant for their projects is over! It was a great challenge and even more inspiring journey for our community of builders, creators and innovators!

Many projects didn't use only Cohere and Qdrant technology, but also included many cutting edge technologies, such as ChatGPT. Also, worth mentioning, it was the first AI Hackathon where participants were provided with 5 categories and winners of those categories were announced finalists and were invited to the final pitch!

[Categories:](https://lablab.ai/event/multilingual-semantic-search-hackathon#:~:text=Categories%3A,purchase%20or%20see)

1. Internal Knowledge base search
2. Legal document search
3. Forum Search
4. Customer review
5. Recommendations

And the main prize was:

* $2,000 cash prize
* $5,000 Cohere credits
* $5,000 Qdrant Cloud credits
* Virtual coffe with Nils Reimers, Director of Machine Learning at Cohere

And every category winner got:

* $500 cash prize
* $2,000 Cohere credits
* $2,000 Qdrant Cloud credits
* All finalists will receive swag and get featured on Cohere’s App Examples page

And last, and not least, the important thing is that, for the first time, we invited a [Wild Card](https://lablab.ai/blog/were-growing-with-our-community-new-features-on-lablabai#voting-program) finalist to present his projects and compete for the main prize. We want to give voice to our community and it was an amazing opportunity to do so!

Ok, but who won?

If you didn’t know, [the winning project](https://lablab.ai/event/multilingual-semantic-search-hackathon/ai-disruptor/ai-brand-intel) was created by one person - Misbah Syed, who already won the previous Cohere AI Hackathon. And the winner of the **customer review category** won the heart of judges due to its complexity, ready to market and many more! And short information about the app itself:

An [amazing project](https://lablab.ai/event/multilingual-semantic-search-hackathon/dragon/legal-ease) was created by team Dragon. The winners of the** legal document category** created a tool to simplify legal documents to common use.

“Legal-ease is a web-app hosting a suite of tools useful for simplifying legal documents for common use.[...] This is great for people who don't have the time, are not native speakers of English or otherwise struggle with legal documents on a day to day basis.[...]”

Winners of the **internal knowledge base search category **presented a powered by ChatGPT API, Cohere, Qdrant and Whisper [solution](https://lablab.ai/event/multilingual-semantic-search-hackathon/wiki-search/joan-holloway) to “discover the power of of your corporate knowledge”

“[...] Recordings of presentations and meetings are the richest source of knowledge, but they were left outside knowledge management due to technical difficulties. Simple transcription and semantic search of that content could significantly boost corporate knowledge accessibility. [...]

A [solution](https://lablab.ai/event/multilingual-semantic-search-hackathon/savvy-synapses/easefind) provided by team Savvy Synapses won the **recommendations category**, but none of the team members joined the winner announcement stream and had the opportunity to change judges' minds.

“[...] With the increasing volume of data generated every day, traditional keyword-based search engines can struggle to provide accurate and relevant results. This is where our solution comes in, offering a cutting-edge approach to search that enables customers to find what they're looking for quickly and easily. [...]”


### Finalist and a community choice - Logos

Amazing [project](https://lablab.ai/event/multilingual-semantic-search-hackathon/abacates-voadores/logos) that stole the heart of our community was from team Abacetes Voadores. An astonishing personal knowledge based assistant!

“We created Logos with the goal of enhancing people’s experiences in their relationship with their sources of knowledge: books and articles they read, podcasts and songs they listen to, videos they watch and spaces where they discuss. [...]”
