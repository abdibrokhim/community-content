## What are AI Hackathons, generative AI models and are they for me?

An AI hackathon is an event where people collaborate to generate creative solutions to problems they identify, using generative models of AI technology (eg. Cohere, Stable Diffusion, etc.) as a tool. During [AI Hackathons](https://lablab.ai/event) participants have an opportunity to work together for a couple of days in order to develop their ideas and create prototypes or functioning solutions. Hackathons offer a great opportunity to acquire new skills (you will learn a lot in order to deliver a working model in 3 or 7 days!), make connections (as Iâ€™m writing this article 16116 amazing participants from all around the world joined our AI Hackathons) and create a working prototype of something which can be the foundation of your future millions worth startup! If you're interested in participating in a hackathon, here are some useful tips to follow:


### ðŸ‘¥ Team up

First, find a hackathon that matches your interests and goals. This can be a local event in your area or a more competitive, larger hackathon. Our recommendation for someone who wants to start his journey with generative AI models (or already knows how to work with them) is by enrolling in one of the lablab.ai [AI hackathons](https://lablab.ai/event).

**Ok, I chose my dream AI Hackathon. Andâ€¦ whatâ€™s now?**

1. Once you've discovered an AI hackathon, it's time to partner with some fellow hackers! First, get in touch with your personal network. You may have friends or colleagues who are interested in joining an AI hackathon. Ask around to see if anyone is interested in forming a team with you for the hackathon.
2. Utilize social media. LinkedIn and Facebook are useful for connecting with people who are interested in participating in hackathons. Post about your interest in attending a hackathon in relevant groups. This could be a useful way to discover potential teammates for the hackathon.
3. Hackathons often have a method for connecting participants with potential teammates. Reach out to the organizers to see if they can help you find others who need teammates. On Lablab.ai, for example, we have a dedicated _looking for a team_ channel on the [lablab.ai Discord server](https://discord.gg/lablab-ai-877056448956346408).

### ðŸ’¡ Generate a great idea

Once you have a team, you and your teammates should begin to develop ideas. The most effective way to come up with ideas is to brainstorm as a team. To begin, identify a problem or challenge that you want to solve and then brainstorm potential solutions.

As you decide on a concept, take into consideration the following factors:

* **Is it feasible?** Can the concept be implemented within the time frame of the hackathon?
* **Is it original?** Is the concept unique and different from other ideas being proposed?
* **Is it useful?** Does the concept solve a real problem or need?
* **Is it marketable?** Is there a potential market for the concept?

After deciding on a concept, it's time to start implementing it. This process is likely to involve researching, developing a plan, and executing it. Keep your time management effective and organized.


### âœ¨ Create an awesome demo and pitch

Read our [Guidelines for Creating a Project Pitch](https://lablab.ai/blog/guidelines-for-creating-a-project-pitch) and watch _How to Pitch Yourself_ by Simon Olson which offers valuable tips and advice for creating a successful project pitch. They provide detailed information on what to include in a project pitch and how to effectively present it.

### ðŸ˜º Having fun is what it's all about!

Last but not least, remember to have fun! AI Hackathons are a great opportunity and challenge yourself, so take advantage of them! Investing 3 or 7 days of your life to change your career, build a solution for problems in your field of expertise or learn how to use the newest generative AI models in my opinion is worth at least trying ðŸ™‚

In general, participating in an AI Hackathon can be a fulfilling experience. By implementing these steps, you can come up with great concepts and turn them into successful solutions. And where do you start looking for such amazing events? For sure I can recommend you our [lablab.aiâ€™s AI Hackathons.](https://lablab.ai/event)
