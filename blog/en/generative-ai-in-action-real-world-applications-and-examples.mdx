## What is generative AI?

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that involves training MLL (machine learning models) to generate new, original content based on a delivered prompt. A prompt can be anything from text and images to music and video, and even [new chemical compounds for use in drug development](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj79OTLjLD8AhXokIsKHUsaA-IQFnoECAwQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F2212.08104&usg=AOvVaw0Q7c2mC3q7rpqyCbuTvIa-). In this way, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries and applications.

## But we all heard about ChatGPT, right? So what is it exactly?

Chatbots and conversational AI, which are technologies that have been used in various applications on the internet. Chatbots are software programs that are designed to simulate conversation with human users through text or voice interactions. They can be used in customer service, information gathering, and other applications where it is useful to have an automated system that can communicate with users. Conversational AI, such as the GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer) models developed by OpenAI, are a type of chatbot that use machine learning techniques to generate responses based on a given input. These models have been used in a variety of applications, including language translation, language generation, and dialogue systems.

## And how can I use Generative AI?

One of the most exciting aspects of generative AI is its ability to create entirely new forms of content. For example, generative models can be used to write news articles or stories that are indistinguishable from those written by humans. This has the potential to greatly increase the efficiency and speed of content creation for media organizations.

Generative AI can also be used to create stunningly realistic images and videos. This can be used to create immersive video game environments, movie special effects, or even personalized product images for e-commerce websites. The possibilities here are truly endless.

In addition to generating visual content, generative AI can also be used to create music and audio. This can range from original songs and compositions to human-like voice audio for use in voiceovers or assistive technologies.

One of the more practical applications of generative AI is in the field of drug discovery. By training machine learning models to generate new chemical compounds, researchers can more quickly identify potential candidates for use in new drugs. This has the potential to greatly accelerate the drug development process, ultimately leading to the creation of more effective and widely available treatments for a variety of diseases.

Overall, the applications of generative AI are vast and varied, and it has the potential to transform many different industries and fields. As the technology continues to advance, it will be interesting to see the new and innovative ways in which it is used in the future.
