## What is AutoGPT?

Auto-GPT is an open-source Python application that was posted on GitHub on March 30, 2023, by a developer called Significant Gravitas. Using GPT-4 as its basis, the application allows the AI to act ‚Äúautonomously‚Äù without the need for the user to prompt every action. 

Auto-GPT has internet access, long-term and short-term memory management, GPT-4 for text generation and file storage, and summarization with GPT-3.5, according to the GitHub post. Anything you can ask ChatGPT, like debugging code and writing an email, you can ask Auto-GPT. However, you can ask Auto-GPT to complete even more advanced tasks, with fewer prompts and it will first make a plan of achieving it and then will execute it.

AutoGPT can be used to accomplish a variety of tasks, such as research, coding, and creative writing, by assigning roles and goals and using its capability. It is accessed through a web-based interface, which allows users to view data and reports generated by the program.

We encourage you to know more about its capabilities and explore [AutoGPT app](https://lablab.ai/apps/tech/autogpt)


## Use cases of AutoGPT

<Img src="https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/3b2a715d-a3f8-47cc-819c-a9a3286e4700/full" alt="two robots" />

AutoGPT is an autonomous agent that can perform a wide range of tasks, including web research, coding, and executing to-do lists. It can work on complex problems requiring long-term planning and multiple steps. Real-world use cases include creating self-completing to-do lists, preparing podcast outlines, and building web applications. It can also be used to generate research papers or articles based on given keywords and summarize existing research articles.


### To-do list

AutoGPT is an open-source Python application based on GPT-4 that can self-prompt. In other words, if the user states an end goal, the system can work out the steps needed to get there and carry them out. It comes with internet access, long- and short-term memory management, GPT-4 instances for text generation, access to popular websites and platforms, and file storage and summarization with GPT-3.5.

If AutoGPT will fail on any task from the list, will use all of the data collected to redesign the to-do list and continue with the new steps in order to achieve the goal provided.

And can you incorporate this idea into your app? Sure! For example, The [Do Anything Machine](https://www.doanythingmachine.com/) is a ‚Äòto-do list that does itself‚Äô, according to creator Garrett Scott McCurrach, CEO at Pipedream Labs. If given access to a user‚Äôs applications, this personal AI agent will prioritize and complete your tasks for you. Sounds amazing? You can join the waitlist to see for yourself!


### Preparing outlines

AutoGPT can research recent events and prepare a comprehensive podcast/article/youtube video outline. It can be completed with accurate references and a cold open. For example, with just a few searches and web browsing, the AI can create a five-topic podcast based on recent news. Or maybe you want to use it to know all the newest events regarding stocks, events in your neighborhood, or the life of your favorite celebrity? Actually, the potential is unlimited, and it‚Äôs up to you how you will use it.


### Building web apps

Did you think that programming with ChatGPT or GPT-4 was easy? It was but like 3 months ago! Now AutoGPT can not only write a working code, but even create the app by itself. It will use only your keywords to generate code snippets or even entire programs based on your specifications. [For example](https://twitter.com/VarunMayya/status/1643902198164717569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1643902198164717569%7Ctwgr%5E84ada56ab9b0149ae5c14d8e14e08ea1f97abc51%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdataconomy.com%2F2023%2F04%2F19%2Fbest-autogpt-examples-use-cases%2F), if you give it the keywords ‚Äúweather‚Äù and ‚Äúapp‚Äù, it might create an app that shows the current weather and forecast for your location.

Just use [AutoGPT API](https://lablab.ai/tech/autogpt), set up your personal agent, and start developing üôÇ


## For whom is Autogpt?

As many individual users and businesses incorporated CHatGPT into their workflow and increased their performance and revenue, the same outcome can be expected with AutoGPT. This experimental open-source application showcases the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model beyond any prompt engineer operating it by himself would imagine. This program, driven by GPT-4, chains together LLM ‚Äúthoughts‚Äù, to autonomously achieve whatever goal you set. It doesn't matter if you are a commercial user or not. Improve your daily life with it and the performance of your business.

Auto-GPT is designed to help businesses increase their net worth by providing intelligent recommendations and insights into their current processes. It can also be used by individuals for tasks such as writing code, building an app, ordering a pizza, researching, preparing podcasts, making your Google Workspace better, philosophizing, and more. As I mentioned before - potential is limited and it‚Äôs up to you how will you use your new AI agent!


## AutoGPT vs GPT-4

As I mentioned before, AutoGPT harvests the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model and pushes it even further. It will adapt to the task provided and will surf the internet in order to do it. It is not a personal text-to-txt assistant trained on data until 2021 - it is a fully functional software with access to up-to-date data. Auto-GPT pushes the boundaries of what is possible with AI.

Unlike ChatGPT, which is limited to text generation, Auto-GPT can search the internet, interact with files, and perform a wide range of tasks with little human intervention. Auto-GPT chains together LLM thoughts to achieve the goals you set, making it an incredibly versatile tool for personal and business use.

GPT-4 has more capabilities to come, such as drawing charts, image generation, and more. It's a huge step forward from ChatGPT, which was a massive breakthrough, but AutoGPT is allowing GPT-4 to maximize its potential. Just use GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 key and use it to power AutoGPT.

The only drawback of using Auto-GPT I can think of is its high cost. I mean, I am using already GPT-4, so I am paying extra in comparison to ChatGPT, but those who didn't try it yet, might notice a difference. With each step, Auto-GPT makes a call to the GPT-4 model which spends quickly your GPT-4 tokens. According to OpenAI, GPT-4 with an 8K context window charges $0.03 per 1,000 tokens for prompts and $0.06 per 1,000 tokens for results


## Can I build an app using AutoGPT?
