## 48 Hours of Innovating and Learning
**Whisper OpenAI Hackathon** has just concluded, and it was a great success! We had a lot of fun using this tool to create innovative solutions for speech recognition. We were able to create applications that can transcribe in multiple languages, as well as translate from those languages into English. 

This was a great opportunity for us to learn more about speech processing and to create some useful applications!

You can relive our impressive 48 hours in the 1-minute video so you can get a glimpse of what it was like!

[Whisper by OpenAI](https://lablab.ai/blog/openai-whisper-announcement) - a voice recognition system that changes the game's rules. This model was trained for **680,000 hours** (about 77 years!) which is said to be so it has a high level of robustness and accuracy, approaching human-level performance. 

This is a huge step forward in the field of AI and has the potential to change the way many businesses operate. We're extremely happy to have the LabLab.ai community on board to build with the freshest and most powerful generative AI model.

Thank you to all **1700 participants** for creating innovations with AI at the Whisper OpenAI Hackathon!  

### ðŸ¥‡ Team Blue 
Choosing just three winners from the 20 incredible submissions was tough, but the first prize goes to Team Blue for their project, InvestogAId.

[InvestogAId](https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-hackathon/Blue/InvestogAId) uses OpenAI Whisper and GPT-3 to create an automated transcription tool to watch your favorite stock trading videos and implement your strategies. Great work, Team Blue! 


### ðŸ¥ˆ Team Biscoff
In the second place, we have **Team Biscoff** with their project, [Moriarty](https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-hackathon/Biscoff/Moriarty). The solution to this problem is to utilize each user's microphone to assess whether his speech is obscene, toxic, threatening, insulting, etc., using cutting-edge Machine Learning tools. Well done, Team Biscoff! 


### ðŸ¥‰ Team Boss
And in third place, we have **Team Boss** with their project, Butter. 

[Butter](https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-hackathon/Boss/Butter) is a chatbot that helps people who stutter. It uses AI-based speech-to-text conversion to output messages from live voice recordings accurately. It also answers personal questions regarding stuttering. Congratulations, Team Boss! 

Thanks again to everyone who took part. You all are going to blow us away with what you come up with next! Make sure you keep an eye on our [upcoming events](https://lablab.ai/event) at LabLab.ai!
