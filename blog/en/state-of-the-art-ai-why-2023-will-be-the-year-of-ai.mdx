## What happened in 2022?

Long story short, many LLM models have broken into the mainstream and flooded all social media platforms this year. Everyone heard in 2022 about ChatGPT ([million users in 5 days](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chatgpt-gained-1-million-followers-224523258.html)), which outbeat instagram which [needed 2,5 months](https://www.diplomacy.edu/blog/generative-ai-models-a-fun-game-that-can-easily-get-out-of-hand/)! I think everyone saw at least once in 2022 a graphic generated by Dall-e, Stable Diffusion or Midjourney. [Millions of funds](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/google-acquires-twitter-backed-ai-avatar-startup-alter-for-100-million-source-says/?guccounter=1) have been invested into the sector and I think everyone has an opinion about AI (for sure different ones have [artists talking about copyright issues](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/artstation-artists-stage-mass-protest-against-ai-generated-artwork/) than [health care professionals](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20220624/Using-AI-to-save-the-lives-of-mothers-and-babies.aspx) about how it improves their work). One is for sure - [the AI industry is booming](https://newnative.ai/news/the-ai-economy-and-future-of-ai-natives) and we might be facing a[ fourth](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2022.913168/full) or [fifth industrial revolution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022435922000288) - depending on who and how it describes it.

So, whatâ€™s more to come?

### ðŸŽ‰ Happy AI 2023!

2023 is set to be a revolutionary year for Artificial Intelligence. With the continued development of AI technology, more and more businesses are beginning to invest in the potential of AI to automate processes and increase efficiency. Thanks to open source technologies AI is also becoming more accessible and affordable for businesses, which will help to drive its adoption. It is no longer a monopol technology for the biggest tech giants.

First and foremost, 2023 will see the emergence of AI-powered solutions for customer service - ChatGPT might be the simplest example. AI-powered solutions are designed to provide a more personalized customer experience and can even automate customer service tasks. Already in 2022 [Cohere launched a multilingual model](https://txt.cohere.ai/multilingual/) which supports 100+ languages and itâ€™s [super easy to implement](https://lablab.ai/t/cohere-how-to-use-the-new-multilingual-model). Furthermore, AI-powered solutions will be able to handle more complex customer inquiries and offer improved customer support.

In addition to customer service, AI will also be used to enhance the accuracy and speed of decision-making processes in businesses. AI-powered solutions can process large amounts of data and make decisions quickly and accurately, which will help businesses make better decisions in less time. Remember the winners of OpenAI Whisper Hackathon, [InvestogAId](https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-hackathon/Blue/InvestogAId) a transcription tool that will watch your favorite video about a stock trading strategy and implement it for you?

Finally, AI will also be used to develop more advanced applications and products. AI-powered solutions can be used to create more innovative and sophisticated products and applications. This will help to boost the overall productivity and efficiency of businesses, as well as to create new opportunities and revenue streams. The question is what does app will be, and which problems of 2022 will they solve?
