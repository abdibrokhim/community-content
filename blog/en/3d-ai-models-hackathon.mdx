The challenge posed to participants was both exhilarating and demanding. In just one weekend, they had to create unique AI applications utilizing the remarkable 3D models provided by [OpenAI](https://lablab.ai/tech/openai), [Nvidia](https://lablab.ai/tech/get3d), and [Stable Diffusion](https://lablab.ai/tech/stable-diffusion). These models have the potential to disrupt industries and change the way we approach tasks that involve 3D modeling and visualization.

The participants were encouraged to think beyond the boundaries of what's currently possible and push the 3D AI models to their limits. The hackathon wasn't just a competition; it was a platform for innovation, experimentation, and pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with AI and 3D modeling.
