We are changing the world of intelligent applications using AI, guys! The Stable Diffusion Hackathon was a great success! We had a lot of fun building with the Stable Diffusion image generative model and learned much about how this generative AI model can be applied.

40 teams during 48 hours were creating absolutely innovative solutions using this [Generative AI](https://lablab.ai/blog/generative-ai-ai-transformers) model for AD tech, Edutech, entertainment technologies, and storytelling tools. It is awe-inspiring for us to check all the submitted projects, and many of them can be launched concisely for users to play with!

[Stable Diffusion](https://lablab.ai/tech/stable-diffusion) is a deep learning, text-to-image model that was released in 2022 by Stability AI. It's used to generate detailed images based on text descriptions. Still, it can also be applied to tasks like inpainting, outpainting, and generating image-to-image translations guided by a text prompt.

It's a massive innovation field, and we thank more than 770 participants for creating a future with AI in the lablab.ai community!
 
Here are the winners, congratulations:
