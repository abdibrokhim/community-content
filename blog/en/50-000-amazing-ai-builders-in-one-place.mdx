## We Made It: Celebrating a Monumental 50k Milestone

As we stand at the peak of this incredible accomplishment, it's time to celebrate not just the numbers, but the passion, dedication, and hard work that has brought us to this point. Lablab.ai's community of 50,000 AI enthusiasts and builders is more than just a statistic; it's a testament to the power of collaboration and the shared belief in a brighter future through AI-led innovation.

From humble beginnings, our community has grown exponentially, driven by an insatiable curiosity and an unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI technology. We've achieved so much together, but reaching 50,000 members is just the beginning of our extraordinary journey. 

And during all of the lablab.ai events over 3500 teams created 800 prototypes of AI-based apps, which are solving the world's problems. See all of the [ChatGPT applications](https://lablab.ai/apps/tech/openai/chatgpt), [apps build with Stable-diffusion](https://lablab.ai/blog/7-app-ideas-you-can-build-with-stable-diffusion), and many more blazing technologies created during the [Artificial Intelligence hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event).
