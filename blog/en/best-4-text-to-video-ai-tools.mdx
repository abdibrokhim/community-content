## AI is revolutionizing the creative industry

It’s been over 7 months since the release of ChatGPT and there were many AI-related virals like MidJourney images of arresting [Donald Trump](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65069316) or [Pope Francis wearing a puffer jacket](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pope-francis-puffer-jacket-fake-photos-deepfake-power-peril-of-ai/). We had food commercials (e.g. [pizza](https://www.creativebloq.com/news/ai-pizza-ad)) created with text-to-video models and even [Balenciaga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE39q-IKOzA) virals animating images. 

So what does it mean? Well, in my opinion, we are facing a creative revolution. People who can't afford a graphic designer don’t have to do a poor design by themselves - some AI tools will do a great job for them. People can make funny videos without investing so much time into them. Or even more ambitious ones - the potential is limitless. I think we are facing into the direction of an era where ideas will be the most important, as execution can be done in no time and without that many expanses (financial and time).

I believe it’s a true creative revolution and democratizing a creative process. And to those who say artists won’t be needed, I can say, that I see what Stable Diffusion videos I was doing as I started using it and… If I compared the quality, the idea, and the whole experience from the viewer's perspective to videos created with the same tools of a friend of mine, who’s a visual artist working with animation tools, the difference is huge.

So yeah, you can learn how to use those tools and master them, but people with expertise in any field will have an advantage over you, but what did you expect? AI is an enhancement of your process, not the process itself.

Just one last thing - the AI revolution for the creative industry is happening and even at the [Cannes Festival in 2023](https://www.cogxfestival.com/cannes-2023) they were aware of it. Let that sink it.

## Unleashing the Power of Text-to-Video AI Tools

<Img src="https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/bbc0de8d-7d51-410d-0076-0fc5d3390900/full" alt="a camera robot" />

Text-to-video is an innovative technology, powered by artificial intelligence, that enables users to effortlessly create captivating videos from text inputs. This cutting-edge tool is gaining popularity among businesses and individuals for its ability to generate engaging visual content seamlessly.

The market offers a diverse array of text-to-video apps, which I am describing in more detail below. By employing advanced AI algorithms, these platforms can efficiently produce videos using text from diverse sources such as written documents, PDFs, emails, or even slide presentations. These AI video tools also provide users with a plethora of customization choices, catering to multiple languages to facilitate global outreach.

Leveraging natural language processing and machine learning techniques, text-to-video generators transform text scripts into appealing videos complete with clips, subtitles, background tunes, and sleek transitions. As the AI system processes massive volumes of text-image data and studies the motion in video footage sans text, it progressively learns to craft audiovisual content that mirrors the input text.

Moreover, each text-to-video tool brings a unique approach to the table. For instance, some companies utilize autoregressive transformers to bolster their natural language modeling capabilities. This diverse range of AI video solutions caters to the individual needs and preferences of users, making text-to-video generation an invaluable asset in today's digital landscape.

## Democratizing video production with AI

<Img src="https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/c7e614fc-cfd8-4899-1810-203082c10d00/full" alt="a robot cameraman" />

You already can explore [text-to-image](https://lablab.ai/blog/how-to-create-an-image-with-ai-5-top-ai-generative-apps) generation, [text-to-3D](https://lablab.ai/blog/ai-revolution-for-game-industry-best-best-ai-text-and-image-to-3d-generation) generation, [image-to-3D](https://lablab.ai/blog/ai-revolution-for-game-industry-best-best-image-to-3d-ai-tools) generation, or enjoy many perfect [AI tools for scriptwriters](https://lablab.ai/blog/ai-revolution-for-movie-industry-best-ai-tools-for-scriptwriters). So why the AI revolution for the creative industry should stop there?

Of course, some of those tools are not perfect yet, but just as we would go a year back we… did not have any of them accessible, or accessible to a few.

It means there will be more and more content, due to production’s cost reduction. Many more people will be (and already are) able to make world-class content that can compete with the best Animation productions out there. And that’s a fact.

And my prediction is that, after we will be already tired of amazing, high-quality content, but boring content, the good ideas will be the winners. As with Balenciaga’s viral videos - the idea is the thing that counts.

So welcome to the world, where idea (not the content) is the king!

### So how can you benefit from it?

First, learn how to use those tools. Understand them, test all of them, and see the limitations of each of their capabilities of it. Play around, don't be afraid to fail. Just practice, practice, and practice. Those tools are new and no one ever could use them before. Of course, specialists in the field have an advantage, but you can become one with time.

And as you know, how to do things, you have two options.

Either you use them to build your business around them or see the limitations of existing tools and create new ones. And as you go deeper into the rabbit hole, you already know, that it’s not that hard.

And as you are reading it, you already know, that you can create a creative [AI app](https://lablab.ai/apps) changing the creative industry forever during lablab.ai [AI Hackathons](https://lablab.ai/event).

So go out there and create content and come back later to build an app to do the things you have to do manually. Or build them right away.
