Hold tight, dear readers! Prepare for the grand revelation of the eminent Redis Sidequest champion. But first, let's shed light on the remarkable features that defined this edition.

Imagine participating in one or more of the 7 AI Hackathons, harnessing the power of [Redis](https://lablab.ai/tech/redis) to devise a remarkable solution. After seven days of relentless effort, you're on the cusp of transforming your project into a thriving startup! This incredible opportunity, offered by lablab.ai's and Redis's SideQuest, grants winning projects additional momentum on their transformative journey. Behold the pinnacle of AI through the Hackathon Artificial Intelligence, brought to you exclusively by lablab.ai!

Let's delve into some enthralling figures: across all 7 AI Hackathons, over 16,500 lablab.ai community members engaged with Redis technology. As a result, 43 fully functional [Redis app](https://lablab.ai/apps/tech/redis) prototypes were unveiled!

Our esteemed panel of judges diligently assessed each project, taking into account criteria such as completion, presentation approach, practicality, market value, innovation, distinctiveness, advanced tech usage, potential impact, and overall impression. Undoubtedly, the competition was fierce, but the moment to disclose the winner and finalists has arrived!

Without further ado, it's time to introduce the exceptional trailblazers poised to revolutionize the AI startup landscape! *drumroll*

### Winner - Memoiz

The first prize was awarded to the ingenious [Memoiz](https://lablab.ai/event/ai-startup-hackathon-episode-2/we-absolutely-have-no-idea/memoiz) app!

Navigating extensive databases can be daunting, particularly when unsure of the targeted information. Existing tools like ChatGPT supplement Google, but aren't ideal for personal data handling. Memoiz, an ingenious solution, addresses this issue.

The core of Memoiz lies in its primary database storing text data and the optional secondary database for embeddings (both potentially on Redis Stack). Archived text data is transformed by Cohere Embed into a 4096-dimensional vector and saved on the Redis server. As users converse with Memoiz, their chat history informs the semantic search, providing context for text generation prompts sent to Cohere Generate.

The future of Memoiz envisions a large-scale mood tracker, a powerful language model, and a public API for broader integration.


### Second place - RedTeamAGPT

The second reward goes to outstanding [RedTeamAGPT](https://lablab.ai/event/autonomous-gpt-agents-hackathon/redteamagpt/redteamagpt), a groundbreaking solution for assessing network vulnerabilities in residential and workspaces. Employing advanced technologies like AutoGPT and Langchain, this toolkit delivers effective security testing with a focus on quick engineering and seamless integration into Linux-based security settings.

Utilizing AI, particularly AutoGPT via GPT-3 and Langchain, this toolkit detects vulnerabilities through a series of tests and generates comprehensive security reports. These reports highlight vulnerabilities' severity levels and offer remediation suggestions.

RedAGPT significantly enhances security testing, making it an indispensable tool for professionals seeking to safeguard networks and systems.


### Third place  - Organize your storage with AI

The third place reward goes to [Smart Health](https://lablab.ai/event/openai-hackathon/smarthealth/smart-health), a personal health assistant offering swift, customized health guidance. With services like symptom checkers and tailored health tips, users can efficiently manage their wellness. This remarkable tool is the brainchild of an expert team comprising computer science, medical, arts, and business professionals.

Leveraging GPT3, Redis Vectorized DB, Python, and React, SmartHealth delivers interactive, personalized advice. The database contains details about health conditions, symptoms, causes, and treatments, which, when combined with GPT3, enables users to gain insights into their health conditions without in-person doctor visits. This cutting-edge tool adopts a future-proof tech stack to make inventive ideas a reality.


### Two Finalists - Chattyrental and MyThorch

Also among 43 created projects we would like to give an honor mention to 2 more projects - [Chattyrental](https://lablab.ai/event/ai-startup-hackathon-episode-2/chattyrental-ai-room-assistant/chattyrental) and [MyTorch](https://lablab.ai/event/openai-hackathon/hcmuwus/mythorch-revolutionary-documents-interaction).

Congratulations for creating unique and so advanced apps and we can;t wait to see more of you!
