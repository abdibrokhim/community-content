## What is ESRGAN?

Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) is a kind of the GAN model. The main idea of the GANs models is to prepare two neural networks, which are playing a game together. Players are the generator and the discriminator. The first of them is generating data, the second has to check if a photo is real or fake.

In the first step, the generator creates a new image. Then the discriminator verifies whether the generated photo is real or not. At this point, GAN calculates two losses, for generator and discriminator. The generator learns how good was his image and the discriminator learns how good was his verification. 

[ESRGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219) is the pre-trained model with vgg19 weights.

## How to prepare ESRGAN for your purpose
Firstly you have to upload your dataset to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/). In this tutorial, I will use the dataset from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) called [CalebA](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset). This dataset contains over 200k images of celebrities' faces. The resolution is 218x178 with 3 channels.

*If you want to use the same dataset, I recommend uploading only 10 000 images.*

Nevertheless, you can use whatever you want!

### Notebook
ESRGAN needs GPU with a large memory capacity, so in the tutorial, I use [Google Colab](https://research.google.com./colaboratory/). In which you can change **Runtime type**, click **Runtime**  and choose **GPU** in **Hardware accelerator**. 
 
### Repository 
 
Now we need to clone the repository with implemented ESRGAN 

```bash
!git clone https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN
%cd PyTorch-GAN/
```
 and install requirements.
```bash
!sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
%cd implementations/esrgan/
```
 
### Loading data

Then, we can connect Google Drive with Google Colab by command:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```
I use the patool lib to extract files from my rar to Google Colab.

```python
!pip install patool
import patoolib
patoolib.extract_archive("/content/drive/MyDrive/name_of_your_file.rar", outdir="/content/PyTorch-GAN/data")
``` 
**Important** `outdir`must be `"/content/PyTorch-GAN/data"`

### Testing dataset

A good practice is to have a testing dataset. The data was not used to train a model. To create testing set we can transfer some data from `data/name_of_your_folder` to `data/test` folder. 

Firstly we have to create a new folder
```python
!mkdir -p /content/PyTorch-GAN/data/test
```
After that, we move a few images to `test` folder.
```python
import os
from glob import glob

paths = glob("/content/PyTorch-GAN/data/name_of_your_folder/*")
samples = 5 # count of photos to move

for no, path in enumerate(paths[:samples]):
    os.replace(path, f"/content/PyTorch-GAN/data/test/{no}.jpg")
```

If the uploaded count of images is too big. You can use:

```python
import os
from glob import glob

paths = glob("/content/PyTorch-GAN/data/name_of_your_folder/*")
samples = 1000 # count of photos to left

for no, path in enumerate(paths):
  if no > samples:
    os.remove(path)
```

### Training

Let's train the neural network!

To train the ESRGAN model we have to write a command with arguments:
```python
!python3 esrgan.py --dataset_name 10k --n_epochs 20 --checkpoint_interval 250
```

Available arguments:

`--dataset_name` name of your folder in `/content/PyTorch-GAN/data`

`--n_epochs` number of epochs (default 200)

`--hr_height`height of output (default 256)

`--hr_width` width of output  (default 256)

`--channesl`channels of input (default 3)

`--checkpoint_interval` I recommend setting it as 250 if you have a small dataset. (default 5000)

The rest arguments you can find [HERE](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN/blob/master/implementations/esrgan/esrgan.py).

Inside the folder `'/content/PyTorch-GAN/implementations/esrgan/images/training` you can find the saved images from the training process.

### Testing

To test our model we need an image. We use the images which we have transferred before to `test` folder.

```python
from glob import glob
paths = glob("/content/PyTorch-GAN/data/test/*")
print(path)
```
```notebook
/content/PyTorch-GAN/data/test/0.jpg
/content/PyTorch-GAN/data/test/1.jpg
/content/PyTorch-GAN/data/test/2.jpg
/content/PyTorch-GAN/data/test/3.jpg
/content/PyTorch-GAN/data/test/4.jpg
```

We can run the model with the command:
```python
!python3 test_on_image.py --image_path /content/PyTorch-GAN/data/test/0.jpg --checkpoint_model /content/PyTorch-GAN/implementations/esrgan/saved_models/generator_1.pth
```
Available arguments:

`--image_path` name of your image in `/content/PyTorch-GAN/data/test/0.jpg`

`--checkpoint_model` name of your trained generator `/content/PyTorch-GAN/implementations/esrgan/saved_models/generator_X.pth`

**X replace with a number of the last trained epoch.**

The generated image you can find in `/content/PyTorch-GAN/implementations/esrgan/images/outputs/`

If you want to copy the image to your google cloud write

```python
!sudo cp -r /content/PyTorch-GAN/implementations/esrgan/images/outputs/sr-name_of_image.jpg /content/drive/MyDrive/
```

## Wrapping Up

GAN models astoundingly employ neural networks to teach each other for continuous improvement. Among these, ESRGAN, showcased in this tutorial, focuses on image enhancement. Despite its power, it does require substantial computing resources. As demonstrated, the results after 5 epochs and 10,000 training data might not be perfect, but with more epochs, you'll witness incredible outcomes!
