## What are we cooking today?

Ready to whip up some AI magic? This [GPT-3 tutorial](https://lablab.ai/t/tech/openai/gpt3) will guide you in crafting your own web application, powered by the impressive GPT-3 from OpenAI. With [Python](https://www.python.org/), Streamlit(https://streamlit.io/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/) as your tools, you'll learn the essentials of launching a powered by [GPT-3 application](https://lablab.ai/apps/tech/openai/gpt3). This tutorial is perfect for those with a basic understanding of Python.

We'll be harnessing the power of GPT-3, OpenAI's 175 Billion parameter text transformer. Alongside Python, Streamlit, and GitHub, we'll guide you through the process of building and hosting your [AI application](https://lablab.ai/apps). This tutorial aims to provide a solid foundation in getting a GPT-3 powered web application up and running.

So let's start!

### Getting OpenAI API key

You can get one by signing up to [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/). Once your account is created, you can go to your profile and click the "API Keys" tab or simply click this link [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

### Clone GPT-3 boilerplate from Github

In this tutorial we will be using a GPT-3 boilerplate that will make our lives easier and allow you to build your own GPT-3 powered application in 20 minutes.

Copy this repository [GPT-3-Boilerplate](https://github.com/nextgrid/streamlit_gpt3_boilerplate) onto your computer and add to your own repositories

### Running the project locally

1. You need to go into your project folder and create a virtual environment as your choice (I used  https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
2. Activate the virtual environment by running the following commandif you used venv: `./venv/Scripts/activate`
3. Install the dependencies by running the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the application by running the following command: `streamlit run gpt_app.py`
5. The application will be open in a browser window where you need to enter your API key first.

### About the boilerplate application

The boilerplate application itself is a Poem generator that will generate a poem based on the input words.
We are using the text-davinci-002 model from OpenAI which is defined in the `model.py` file.
Feel free to change the model to any other model that you want to use, and play with the model parameters.
For example you can change **temperature to 0.9** to generate a more random poem.
Feel free to change the whole prompt to any other sentence you want to use.

### Deploy the application on StreamLit
 1. Go to https://share.streamlit.io/ and register your account.
 2. Click on New app
 3. Choose your Repository, Branch name and the main file path (in our case `gpt_app.py`) <Img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/lablab-static-eu/images/tutorials/deploy_streamlit.jpg"/>
 4. Click Deploy!

## Let's wrap it up!

Hope you enjoyed this simple tutorial. Hopefully you now have a simple fundation that will allow you to build other type of applications. And why not to build one during lablab.ai's [AI hackathons](https://lablab.ai/event)?
Alongside with other like-minded people who want to shape the world, fix its problems and build a million worth business with their own [GPT-3 app](https://lablab.ai/apps/tech/openai/gpt3)!
