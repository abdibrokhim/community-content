## Mastering Cohere and FastAPI: A Comprehensive Tutorial for AI Enthusiasts

Tabular data, a prevalent format for data storage and exchange, plays a vital role in various applications like data warehouses, data lakes, and data marts. In this tutorial, we'll explore the creation of a FastAPI application that seamlessly employs Cohere to extract data from tables. This technique is invaluable for developing applications like bots, dashboards, and data explorers that rely on data retrieval.

After honing these skills, don't settle; the AI landscape is expansive and ever-changing, beckoning continual learning. To further practice your Qdrant abilities, consider constructing an API for application data indexing, new record additions, and searches. FastAPI's high-performance, user-friendly framework makes it the ideal tool for this endeavor.

The upcoming [AI Hackathons](https://lablab.ai/event) offers the ideal stage for your ambitions. Those events unites a passionate community of innovators and creators determined to shape the future with AI, providing an unmatched learning, networking, and growth platform.

Spot a problem in your environment and build a [Cohere app](https://lablab.ai/apps/tech/cohere) to address it. Join our thriving network of pioneers and visionaries and make your mark in the AI realm! And while you're at it, don't miss our diverse lineup of events!
 
## üé¨ Introduction
 
Of course we need to create a new project first. Let's create a new project using terminal:
 
```bash
mkdir cohere-tab-Data
 
cd cohere-tab-data
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
 
We have to create `.env` file and add our Cohere API key to it:
 
```
COHERE_API_KEY=<COHERE API KEY>
```
 
Now let's install necessary libraries:
 
```bash
    pip install python-dotenv
    pip install --upgrade cohere
    pip install fastapi[all]
```
 
Now we can create an `app.py` file and write code!
 
### üìù Let's code!
 
First, we need to import libraries:
 
```python
import os
import cohere
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from fastapi import FastAPI
 
load_dotenv()
```
 
Then we need to create a FastAPI application and set up a Cohere client:
 
```python
app = FastAPI()
 
co = cohere.Client(os.getenv('COHERE_API_KEY'))
```
 
I will define some example data that we will use in this tutorial:
 
```python
# Example data
COMPANY_DATA = '''
ID | Name | Position           | Department | Salary
---|------|--------------------|------------|--------
1  | John | Product Manager    | Sales      | 100000
2  | Emmy | UI/UX              | Design     | 90000
3  | Bob  | Software Developer | IT         | 120000
4  | Jane | Data Scientist     | IT         | 160000
5  | Mike | Software Developer | IT         | 130000
6  | Alex | Data Engineer      | IT         | 140000
7  | Bill | Software Developer | IT         | 120000
8  | Kate | Business Analyst   | Sales      | 110000
9  | Mark | UI/UX              | Design     | 95000
10 | Lisa | Social Media       | Marketing  | 80000
11 | Matt | Ads Manager        | Marketing  | 85000
12 | Tom  | SEO                | Marketing  | 80000
'''
 
# Some example queries for model
EXAMPLES = '''
Q: What is the average salary of the Design department?
A: 92500.0
---
Q: Who is the highest paid employee?
A: Alex
---
Q: Who is working in the IT department?
A: Bob, Jane, Mike, Alex, Bill
---
Q: How many employees are there in the Marketing department?
A: 3
---
'''
```
 
Now we can create request handler for our FastAPI application:
 
```python
@app.get('/')
async def data_retreival(request: str):
   
    prompt = f'{COMPANY_DATA}\n\n{EXAMPLES}\nQ: {request}'
    response = co.generate(
        model='xlarge',
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=5,
        temperature=0.75,
        stop_sequences=['--'],
    )
 
    return response.generations[0].text.strip()
```
 
Okay, now we can run our application:
 
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```
 
### üéâ Testing
 
Now we can test our application. Let's try to ask some questions:
 
```
Q: Who is the highest paid employee?
A: Jane
 
Q: How many employees are there in the IT department?
A: 5
 
Q: Who is the highest paid employee in Sales Department?
A: Kate
```
