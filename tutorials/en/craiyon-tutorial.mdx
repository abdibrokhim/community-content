## Introducing Craiyon: Revolutionizing AI-Driven Image Generation

In the realm of AI image creation, [OpenAI's DALL·E](https://lablab.ai/tech/openai/dall-e-2) sparked a wave of innovation. Craiyon (formerly Dalle-e Mini) represents an open-source endeavor to replicate these impressive results. Accessible and free, this trailblazing model has no limitations on image generation, rendering visual wonders at craiyon.com.

## How does Craiyon work? - simple explanation

Basically Craiyon looks at millions of images from the internet with their associated captions and determines repeating and identity-forming patterns from these images. (The AI determines what is common to all images.) Over time, Craiyon then determines what makes up these images. Once Craiyon has completed this,it can create its own new images, since it now knows what constitutes a word or phrase. Here it must be said, of course, that Craiyon  does not really understand the words entered, but only tries to reproduce the essence of the words in images.
Several models are combined together to achieve these results: [detailed resource](https://wandb.ai/dalle-mini/dalle-mini/reports/DALL-E-Mini-Explained-with-Demo--Vmlldzo4NjIxODA)
- an image encoder that turns raw images into a sequence of numbers with its associated decoder
- a model that turns a text prompt into an encoded image
- a model that judges the quality of the images generated for better filtering 

## Craiyon in action

Go to www.craiyon.com. There you will find an input field for your prompts. Type in something interesting like “spaceship flying to mars”, click generate and you will get the generation results about 20 seconds later.

In order to get better results you can use the following prompt tips: 

### Add art style descriptions

There are a million different art styles out there, each with their own unique flair. Some are realistic, while others are more abstract. Some are calm and serene, while others are chaotic and wild. It's up to you, the artist, to decide what style you want to use for your piece. 

- Artist style like “Picasso”, “Van Gogh”
- Tools used like “watercolors”, “oil painting”
- Styles: “Impressionism”, “Expressionism”, “Abstract”

### Add composition descriptions

Composition refers to the overall physical arrangement of objects in the artwork. In other words, composition refers to how the various elements of the painting are arranged within the picture frame.

- “aerial view” or “long shot” or “portrait” or “wide-angle” or “fish-eye lens” or “extreme close-up” or “macro” or “bokeh.”
- Merge objects: 
“looks like” or “in the shape of” , “inside of” or “next to” 

### Add atmosphere/mood descriptions

The atmosphere or mood of an artwork can be just as important as the subject matter. After all, how the artist chooses to portray the subject can have a big impact on how the viewer perceives it.
- “dark” or “colorful” or “futuristic” or “vintage” or “abstract” or “soothing” or “foggy” or “early morning” or childish.”
