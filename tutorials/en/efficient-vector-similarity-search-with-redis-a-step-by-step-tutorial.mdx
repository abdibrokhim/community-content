## Enhancing search results with vector embeddings and Redis

The ability to search for information is crucial in today's digital landscape, with users expecting search functionality in nearly every application and website. To improve search results, architects and developers must continuously explore new methods and architectures. One of the approaches is to utilize vector embeddings generated by deep learning models, which can 
enhance the accuracy and relevance of search results.

To this end, many organizations are leveraging indexing techniques to transform their data into vector space. By representing data as vectors, it becomes possible to perform similarity searches that return the most relevant results.

In this tutorial, we will explore how deep learning models can be used to create vector embeddings, which can then be indexed for efficient and accurate search with the help of Redis. With a thorough understanding of this approach, architects and developers can better appreciate the potential of AI-powered search capabilities and find best ways to improve the search experience for users.

We will go through the process of:
- creating vector embeddings for Amazon product dataset,
- indexing them with Redis
- searching for similar vectors.

We will also explore the pros and cons of different indexing methods and how they can be used to improve search performance.

## Let's get started!

Create a new directory and create a new Jupyter notebook. Get the dataset CSV file from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tHWB6u3yQCuAgOYc-DxtZ8Mru3uV5_lj/view?usp=sharing). Store it in `./data/` dir. We will be using Python 3.8. Install the following 
dependencies in the first cell:

```python
%pip install redis numpy pandas
%pip install -U sentence-transformers
```

After installing the dependencies, you can start by importing the necessary libraries and defining any necessary classes or functions. In this case, we can import the following libraries and define a color class for later use:

```python
import random
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import time
from redis import Redis
from redis.commands.search.field import VectorField
from redis.commands.search.field import TextField
from redis.commands.search.field import TagField
from redis.commands.search.query import Query
from redis.commands.search.result import Result

class color:
   PURPLE = '\033[95m'
   CYAN = '\033[96m'
   DARKCYAN = '\033[36m'
   BLUE = '\033[94m'
   GREEN = '\033[92m'
   YELLOW = '\033[93m'
   RED = '\033[91m'
   BOLD = '\033[1m'
   UNDERLINE = '\033[4m'
   END = '\033[0m'
```

The Redis library is imported to interact with Redis, an in-memory data structure store often used as a database, cache, and message broker. We also import the following classes from `redis.commands.search.field` and `redis.commands.search.query` 
modules:

- `VectorField`: used to represent vector fields in Redis, such as embeddings.
- `TextField`: used to represent text fields in Redis.
- `TagField`: used to represent tag fields in Redis.
- `Query`: used to create search queries for Redis.
- `Result`: used to represent search results returned by Redis.

In addition, we define a color class that can be used to print colored text to the console. The color class has several attributes, such as PURPLE, CYAN, BOLD, etc., which can be used to colorize text output in the console.

The next step involves loading Amazon product data into a Pandas DataFrame, and truncating long text fields to a maximum length of 512 characters, which is the maximum length supported by the pre-trained sentence embedding generator that we will be using later on.

Here's the cell code to load the product data and truncate long text fields:

```python
MAX_TEXT_LENGTH = 512
NUMBER_PRODUCTS = 1000

# define a function to auto-truncate long text fields
def auto_truncate(val):
    return val[:MAX_TEXT_LENGTH]

# load the product data and truncate long text fields
all_prods_df = pd.read_csv("data/product_data.csv", converters={'bullet_point': auto_truncate, 'item_keywords': auto_truncate, 'item_name': auto_truncate})
all_prods_df['primary_key'] = all_prods_df['item_id'] + '-' + all_prods_df['domain_name']
all_prods_df['item_keywords'].replace('', np.nan, inplace=True)
all_prods_df.dropna(subset=['item_keywords'], inplace=True)
all_prods_df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

# get the first 1000 products with non-empty item keywords
product_metadata = all_prods_df.head(NUMBER_PRODUCTS).to_dict(orient='index')
```

The code loads the product data from a CSV file, truncates long text fields, adds a new primary_key column to the DataFrame, filters out any products without keywords, and extracts the metadata for the first 1000 products with non-empty item keywords and stores it in a dictionary called product_metadata.

Let's take a look at the first few rows of the product data:

```python
all_prods_df.head()
```

## Connect to Redis

After loading the product data into a Pandas DataFrame and extracting metadata for the 1000 products, the next step is to connect to Redis. We will be using a Redis instance provided by RedisLabs in their cloud, which offers a free tier. You can sign up for a free account at [redis.com/try-free/](https://redis.com/try-free/).

Spin up a new Redis instance and copy the connection details. You will need to provide a password when connecting to the Redis instance. You can find the password in the connection details page. The password is the same as the password for the default user.

```python	
redis_conn = Redis(
  host='XXX',
  port=XXXXX,
  password="<YOUR-DEFAULT-USER-PW>")
print ('Connected to redis')
```

## Create embeddings

### Using SentenceTransformer

The next step involves generating embeddings (vectors) for the item keywords using a pre-trained Sentence Transformer model called distilroberta-v1. This model is available from the Sentence Transformer library. We will use the SentenceTransformer class to load the model and generate the embeddings.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-distilroberta-v1')

%%time

item_keywords =  [product_metadata[i]['item_keywords']  for i in product_metadata.keys()]
item_keywords_vectors = [ model.encode(sentence) for sentence in item_keywords]
```

Then we will check the dimensions of the embeddings:

```python
len(item_keywords_vectors)
len(product_metadata)
# Check one of the products
product_metadata[0]
```

### Preparing utility functions

Now we have 1000 embeddings for the 1000 products. Next, we will define 3 utility functions. One for loading the product data and two for creating the index on Vector fields.
```python
def load_vectors(client:Redis, product_metadata, vector_dict, vector_field_name):
    p = client.pipeline(transaction=False)
    for index in product_metadata.keys():    
        #hash key
        key='product:'+ str(index)+ ':' + product_metadata[index]['primary_key']
        
        #hash values
        item_metadata = product_metadata[index]
        item_keywords_vector = vector_dict[index].astype(np.float32).tobytes()
        item_metadata[vector_field_name]=item_keywords_vector
        
        # HSET
        p.hset(key,mapping=item_metadata)
            
    p.execute()

def create_flat_index (redis_conn,vector_field_name,number_of_vectors, vector_dimensions=512, distance_metric='L2'):
    redis_conn.ft().create_index([
        VectorField(vector_field_name, "FLAT", {"TYPE": "FLOAT32", "DIM": vector_dimensions, "DISTANCE_METRIC": distance_metric, "INITIAL_CAP": number_of_vectors, "BLOCK_SIZE":number_of_vectors }),
        TagField("product_type"),
        TextField("item_name"),
        TextField("item_keywords"),
        TagField("country")        
    ])

def create_hnsw_index (redis_conn,vector_field_name,number_of_vectors, vector_dimensions=512, distance_metric='L2',M=40,EF=200):
    redis_conn.ft().create_index([
        VectorField(vector_field_name, "HNSW", {"TYPE": "FLOAT32", "DIM": vector_dimensions, "DISTANCE_METRIC": distance_metric, "INITIAL_CAP": number_of_vectors, "M": M, "EF_CONSTRUCTION": EF}),
        TagField("product_type"),
        TextField("item_keywords"),        
        TextField("item_name"),
        TagField("country")     
    ])    
```

## Comparison of flat and HNSW indexing for approximate nearest neighbor search

Flat indexing and HNSW are both methods used in approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces, but they differ in the way they construct and search the index.

Flat indexing is a straightforward approach where all data points are indexed and stored in a single list or tree structure. To find the nearest neighbors of a query point, a brute force search is conducted by computing the distance between the query point and all other points in the index. While simple and easy to implement, flat indexing can be computationally expensive and impractical for large datasets and high-dimensional spaces.

HNSW, on the other hand, stands for Hierarchical Navigable Small World and is a more complex indexing algorithm that organizes data points into a hierarchical graph structure. This graph is built by connecting each point to its nearest neighbors, and then recursively connecting nearby points in a hierarchical manner. This results in a graph structure that is highly clustered and enables fast approximate nearest neighbor search by exploring only a small subset of the graph.

The key advantage of HNSW over flat indexing is its ability to scale to large datasets and high-dimensional spaces. However, HNSW requires more careful tuning of its parameters and may have higher index construction time compared to flat indexing.

### Index & Query the new data

Next, we will load and index the product data using a flat index first. 

```python
%%time

ITEM_KEYWORD_EMBEDDING_FIELD='item_keyword_vector'
TEXT_EMBEDDING_DIMENSION=768
NUMBER_PRODUCTS=1000

print ('Loading and Indexing + ' +  str(NUMBER_PRODUCTS) + ' products')

#flush all data
redis_conn.flushall()

#create flat index & load vectors
create_flat_index(redis_conn, ITEM_KEYWORD_EMBEDDING_FIELD,NUMBER_PRODUCTS,TEXT_EMBEDDING_DIMENSION,'COSINE')
load_vectors(redis_conn,product_metadata,item_keywords_vectors,ITEM_KEYWORD_EMBEDDING_FIELD)
```

### Query our FLAT index

And after this we can query our index and search for the top 5 (topK) nearest neighbors for a given query vector:

```python
%%time
topK=5
product_query='beautifully crafted present for her. a special occasion'
#product_query='cool way to pimp up my cell'

#vectorize the query
query_vector = model.encode(product_query).astype(np.float32).tobytes()

#prepare the query
q = Query(f'*=>[KNN {topK} @{ITEM_KEYWORD_EMBEDDING_FIELD} $vec_param AS vector_score]').sort_by('vector_score').paging(0,topK).return_fields('vector_score','item_name','item_id','item_keywords').dialect(2)
params_dict = {"vec_param": query_vector}


#Execute the query
results = redis_conn.ft().search(q, query_params = params_dict)

#Print similar products found
for product in results.docs:
    print ('***************Product  found ************')
    print (color.BOLD + 'hash key = ' +  color.END + product.id)
    print (color.YELLOW + 'Item Name = ' +  color.END  + product.item_name)
    print (color.YELLOW + 'Item Id = ' +  color.END  + product.item_id)
    print (color.YELLOW + 'Item keywords = ' +  color.END  + product.item_keywords)
    print (color.YELLOW + 'Score = ' +  color.END  + product.vector_score)
```

```

```

### Query our HNSW index

It's working! That's great! Now let's try the same with HNSW indexing. First Load and index product data.

```python
%%time
print ('Loading and Indexing + ' +  str(NUMBER_PRODUCTS) + ' products')

ITEM_KEYWORD_EMBEDDING_FIELD='item_keyword_vector'
NUMBER_PRODUCTS=1000
TEXT_EMBEDDING_DIMENSION=768

#flush all data
redis_conn.flushall()

#create flat index & load vectors
create_hnsw_index(redis_conn, ITEM_KEYWORD_EMBEDDING_FIELD,NUMBER_PRODUCTS,TEXT_EMBEDDING_DIMENSION,'COSINE',M=40,EF=200)
load_vectors(redis_conn,product_metadata,item_keywords_vectors,ITEM_KEYWORD_EMBEDDING_FIELD)
```

And now we can query again:

```python
%%time
topK=5
product_query='beautifully crafted present for her. a special occasion'
#product_query='cool way to pimp up my cell'

#vectorize the query
query_vector = model.encode(product_query).astype(np.float32).tobytes()

#prepare the query
q = Query(f'*=>[KNN {topK} @{ITEM_KEYWORD_EMBEDDING_FIELD} $vec_param AS vector_score]').sort_by('vector_score').paging(0,topK).return_fields('vector_score','item_name','item_id','item_keywords','country').dialect(2)
params_dict = {"vec_param": query_vector}


#Execute the query
results = redis_conn.ft().search(q, query_params = params_dict)

#Print similar products found
for product in results.docs:
    print ('***************Product  found ************')
    print (color.BOLD + 'hash key = ' +  color.END + product.id)
    print (color.YELLOW + 'Item Name = ' +  color.END  + product.item_name)
    print (color.YELLOW + 'Item Id = ' +  color.END  + product.item_id)
    print (color.YELLOW + 'Item keywords = ' +  color.END  + product.item_keywords)
    print (color.YELLOW + 'Country = ' +  color.END  + product.country)
    print (color.YELLOW + 'Score = ' +  color.END  + product.vector_score)
```
