## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to use monday.com to retrieve and mutate your workplace and improve your team's experience!

So… without any further ado, let’s dive in!

### monday.com

**[monday.com](https://www.monday.com)** is a work operating system (Work OS) that enables organizations to build custom workflow apps in a code-free environment - to run projects, processes and everyday work. Teams shape workflows and projects, code-free, with an adaptive platform that automates manual work and connects teams in a digital workspace. The platform offers a variety of features, including customizable workflow templates, time tracking, automations, data dashboards, integrations with popular tools and apps.

Recently the [monday.com](https://www.monday.com) team released a beta version of AI assistant for their software! This is great news for all users. It will empower the productivity of their users and on top of that, it will encourage new users to try this great platform.

### monday API & API Key

[monday.com](https://www.monday.com allows you to build your own apps and insert them into their [marketplace](https://monday.com/marketplace). This is great because it allows users to build applications tailored to their needs and also share them with others.

Building such applications requires the use of [monday API](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs). It allows you to integrate external applications into your monday workspace. To access this API you need to retrieve the API Key, this process is outlined [in the monday documentation](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/authentication) and I will not cover it here.

## Coding

### Depedencies


Let's start with design preparation. I will create a directory.

```bash
mkdir monday-first-api-call

cd monday-first-api-call
```

Now it is time for the virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv

# Linux/MacOS
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

And necessary libraries.

```bash
pip install requests python-dotenv
```

Let's now import the libraries into the file.

```python
import os
from datetime import datetime

import requests
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
```

### Prepare our workplace

For the purposes of our project, I will prepare a simple workspace that will contain the boards we will use for our integrations. For more information check out [monday.com](https://www.monday.com).

### Monday API Integrations

OK, now we can start building our integrations. Our aim will be to extract the necessary data and then insert the item into our board.. I'll start by defining a couple of constants - `API_KEY`, `API_URL`. Also, I'll define the header that we'll use for request authorization.

```python
API_KEY = os.getenv("MONDAY_API_KEY") # I will use .env file to store my API key
API_URL = "https://api.monday.com/v2"

authorization_header = {"Authorization": API_KEY}
```

When working with the monday API, we need to bear in mind that it is a GraphQL API. It is a lot of fun to work with and thanks to a good job from the Monday team - the documentation is very clear.

I will now execute the query to get our board.

```python
query_all_boards = "query { boards (limit:1) {id name} }"
data = {"query": query_all_boards}

r = requests.post(url=API_URL, json=data, headers=authorization_header)
result = r.json()
```

Response:

```
{'data': {'boards': [{'id': '1206985347', 'name': 'TEST BOARD'}]}}
```

Now I have to extract the group. I will use the following query for this.

```python
query_board = f"""query {{
                    boards (ids: {BOARD_ID}) {{
                        id
                        name
                        groups {{
                            id
                            title
                        }}
                    }}
                }}"""

data = {"query": query_board}

r = requests.post(url=API_URL, json=data, headers=authorization_header)
result = r.json()
```

Response:

```
{'data': {'boards': [{'id': '1206985347', 'name': 'TEST BOARD', 'groups': [{'id': 'nowa_grupa', 'title': 'TEST GROUP'}]}]}, 'account_id': 17276871}
```

The last missing element is the columns, which we also need to extract.

```python
columns_query = f"""query {{
                        boards (ids: {BOARD_ID}) {{
                            columns {{
                                id
                                title
                            }}
                        }}
                    }}"""

data = {"query": columns_query}

r = requests.post(url=API_URL, json=data, headers=authorization_header)
result = r.json()
```

Response:

```
{'data': {'boards': [{'columns': [{'id': 'name', 'title': 'Name'}, {'id': 'liczby', 'title': 'Numbers'}, {'id': 'tekst', 'title': 'Text'}]}]}, 'account_id': 17276871}
```

Great, now it is time to insert the new data into the board. Take a close look at the query, as it differs significantly.

```python
add_item_query = f"""
            mutation {{
                create_item (
                    board_id: {BOARD_ID},
                    item_name: "TEST VALUE",
                    column_values: "{{
                        \\"tekst\\": \\"TEST TEXT\\",
                        \\"liczby\\": 13
                    }}"
                ) {{
                    id
                }}
            }}
        """
data = {"query": add_item_query}

r = requests.post(url=API_URL, json=data, headers=authorization_header)
result = r.json()
```

Response:

```
{'data': {'create_item': {'id': '1207322707'}}, 'account_id': 17276871}
```

Well, let's check out our result!

Well done! We managed to put the data to the monday board together!!!

## Conclusion

As you can see, working with the [monday.com](https://www.monday.com) API is not difficult. It is a bit different from working with the REST API, but everything is well described here. If you want to use the [monday.com](https://www.monday.com) API in practice I invite you to our [monday.com AI app hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/monday-ai-app-hackathon)! You certainly won't regret it!
