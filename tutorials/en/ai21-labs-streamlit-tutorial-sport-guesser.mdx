## AI21 and Streamlit are worth checking out!

[AI21 Labs](https://lablab.ai/tech/ai21-labs) gives a lot of tools for building AI/NLP powered apps. You can access their models through the official API/SDK! And if you donâ€™t know how to use [AI21 API](https://lablab.ai/t/how-to-use-ai21labs) or want to know more about [AI21](https://lablab.ai/tech/ai21-labs), we got you covered!

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.app/) is open-source Python for creating custom web applications. With this technology you are able to build, for example, a prototype of your application in a short time.

## Our idea

Today I would like to show how, using a model from AI21 Labs and Streamlit, we can build a simple application that will return the name of the described sport based on the description of the sport. The task does not seem difficult, and AI21 and Streamlit make it even easier for us with their great solutions! We will only need an input for the description and a button for confirmation. Let's get to coding!

## Let's create the app!

### Dependencies

First, let's create a new directory for our project and move to it:

```bash
mkdir sports-app
cd sports-app
```

At the beginning, we need to create a virtual environment for our project. Let's do it:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv

# linux/mac
source venv/bin/activate
# windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

Now we need to install the necessary dependencies. Let's do it:

```bash
pip install streamlit ai21 python-dotenv
```

Last, but not least. Let's create a `.env` file to store our API key. We will use it later in our code.

```bash
# linux/mac
touch .env

# windows
echo >.env
```

Okay, now we have all the necessary dependencies installed. Let's create a file called `main.py` and start coding!

### Creating the app

At the beginning, let's define the API key in `.env` file:

```bash
AI21_LABS_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

Now we can import the necessary dependencies and load secrets from:

```python
import os

import ai21
import streamlit as st
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

API_KEY = os.getenv("AI21_LABS_API_KEY")

ai21.api_key = API_KEY
```

Next, let's create a function that will take the description of the sport and return the name of it. I will also define a prompt here.

```python
# Prompt for the model
PROMPT = "Based on the description given, name the sport.\nDescription: {description}\n Sport name: "

# Initialization of the output variable
if "output" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state["output"] = "Output:"

def guess_sport(inp):
    if not len(inp):
        return None

    # overwrite the prompt with the description
    prompt = PROMPT.format(description=inp)

    response = ai21.Completion.execute(
        model="j2-grande-instruct",
        prompt=prompt,
        temperature=0.5,
        minTokens=1,
        maxTokens=15,
        numResults=1,
    )

    # return the name of the sport
    st.session_state["output"] = response.completions[0].data.text

    # a short celebration ðŸ˜‰
    st.balloons()
```

Perfect! Now we can create a simple interface for our app. Let's do it:

```python

st.title("The Sports Guesser")

st.write(
    "This is a simple **Streamlit** app that generates Sport Name based on given description"
)

inp = st.text_area("Enter your description here", height=100)

st.button("Guess", on_click=guess_sport(inp))
st.write(f"Answer: {st.session_state.output}")
```

It's okay, let's run the app!

### Running the app

We can do it using the following command:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

And that's it! We have a simple app that can guess the name of the sport based on the description. Let's try it out!

## Conclusion

As you can see, creating applications using AI21 & Streamlit setup is very easy, basic programming skills are enough, and all the necessary information is easily available in the documentation! I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and I encourage you to try it out yourself!
