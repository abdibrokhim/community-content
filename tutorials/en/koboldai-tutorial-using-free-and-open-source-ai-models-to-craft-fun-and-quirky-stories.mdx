Now we can begin using the Nerys model as our writing assistant. As suggested in the introduction, we need to provide the AI with an idea of what we'll be writing about by setting the scene. Aim for around 10 sentences to make our story interesting.

#### As Creative Writing Assistant

Let's start by writing our setting:

```text
As the hands of the clock converged on the number 10, marking the arrival of the late evening hour, I found myself still ensnared in the confines of my office. The eerie silence of the night was punctuated only by the occasional rustle of papers and the relentless ticking of the clock. This was an unfamiliar scene for me, my first venture into the realm of overtime work that stretched this late into the night.

My impending month-long leave had prompted my boss to extract every last ounce of work from me, a final act of corporate servitude before my temporary departure. The thought of such a prolonged absence from work was unsettling, a disruption to the routine I had grown so accustomed to. Yet, my therapist insisted it was a necessary step, a chance for me to reset and recharge.

Shaking off these contemplations, I was jolted back to reality by the sudden plunge into darkness. The overhead lights, which had been my sole companions in the deserted office, flickered off, leaving me in an ocean of shadows. The janitorial staff must still be around, I reasoned, carrying out their nightly duties.

But something felt amiss. The usual sounds that accompanied their presence - the soft padding of footsteps, the distant hum of conversation - were conspicuously absent. Even more peculiar was the silence that surrounded the moment the lights were switched off. An unsettling quiet that sent a shiver down my spine, turning the mundane into the mysterious.

```

This is a great way to start off our psychological horror novel, isn't it? Type or paste this story into the text input field and then click the "Submit" button. After a moment, KoboldAI will provide a continuation to our opening scene.

For a free and open-source model with smaller training parameters, the Nerys model performs impressively. It added "Was this the same silence that had greeted me upon entering the office? Or was it just my imagination?
I drew my cell phone from my pocket and flipped it open to the camera application. A quick scan of the room confirmed that there was no one else in sight, but something about the scene still felt wrong" as a continuation to our story, seamlessly injecting inner monologue and advancing the plot. This demonstrates the model's effectiveness as a creative writing assistant.

#### Text-Based Adventure Game

Now that we've set the stage with our chilling narrative, it's time to transform it into a text-based adventure game! KoboldAI provides a simple interface that allows us to do just that. Let's start by enabling Adventure Mode. Scroll up and click the "Settings" button, then look for the "Adventure Mode" switch and turn it on.

<Img src="https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/d23cab47-1b93-4158-613b-08e2d0d76200/full" alt="We switch on the adventure mode of KoboldAI" />

With Adventure Mode activated, we're ready to dive into our text-based adventure game! Scroll down to the text input field. You'll notice that it now has two modes: "Action" and "Story". The Action mode is used to dictate the actions of our protagonist, while the Story mode allows us to progress the narrative without the protagonist's direct involvement.

Let's guide our protagonist's next move. Type "You take a step back" into the Action input field. This action reflects the protagonist's growing unease and desire to distance themselves from the mysterious situation.

<Img src="https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/04fad647-08a3-4557-ff61-c8ffed18a400/full" alt="We insert the action to 'take a step back'" />

After submitting our action, KoboldAI responds with a continuation of the story that incorporates our chosen action. It's like playing a virtual game of Dungeons & Dragons, with the AI serving as our Dungeon Master!

The AI has now introduced a mysterious voice into our story. What will happen next? Where is the voice coming from? Will our protagonist make it out of the office safely? The answers to these questions are in the hands of KoboldAI and your own choices, dear adventurer. What action will you choose next?

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've explored how to quickly get started with KoboldAI using Google Colab. This approach allows us to utilize a ready-to-use environment and save on resource usage by leveraging cloud-based computing.

We specifically chose the Nerys model for our demonstration due to its versatility and suitability for both writing assistance and text adventure gaming. Our writing assistance session showcased how the AI, given an initial backdrop of 10 sentences, can continue the story in the expected direction without explicit guidance.

Switching to "Adventure" mode, we took on the role of the protagonist and drove the story forward with our actions. This added a layer of tension and intrigue to the narrative, illustrating the power of KoboldAI in creating engaging and dynamic stories.
