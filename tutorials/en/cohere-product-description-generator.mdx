## 🎯 Journey's End: Mastering Cohere for Product Descriptions
By the time you've reached this point, you've successfully built a product description generator API using [Cohere](https://lablab.ai/tech/cohere). This API is a powerful tool for generating descriptions for your own products. This tutorial is designed for those with a basic understanding of Javascript/NodeJS. If you're new to this language, consider exploring some resources before diving in. The journey doesn't end here, so stay tuned for more [Cohere tutorials](https://lablab.ai/t/tech/cohere)!

We will be using **xlarge** model from Cohere.

### Getting Cohere API Key

You can get one by signing up [https://app.cohere.io/dashboard](https://app.cohere.io/dashboard). Visit the Cohere dashboard to retrieve your API key. If you haven't previously connected a session, you should see it in the main screen. Otherwise, you can find it in the settings page.

### Clone the Express boilerplate from Github

In this tutorial we will be using an express boilerplate that will make our lives easier.

Copy this repository [Express Boilerplate](https://github.com/nextgrid/product-description-generator-cohere-api/tree/starter) onto your computer and add to your own repositories

### Running the project locally

1.  Install the dependencies with yarn or npm
2.  Run the server with `yarn dev` or `npm dev`

### Add the Cohere API key to the .env file

Create a .env file in the root of the project and add your API key to it. Remember never share your API key with anyone.
`COHERE_API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}`

### Create Routing for the API

1.  Create routes folder in the root of the project
2.  Create `description.js` file in the routes folder
3.  Add the following code to the `description.js` file to have a working router

```js
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

router.post("/", async (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

module.exports = router;
```

4. Add the route to the `index.js` file in the root of the project
5. Add the import to the top of the file `const description = require("./routes/description.js");
6. Add the route under the app.get route `app.use("/", description);`

### Create generator function

1. Create a folder in the root of the project called `lib`
2. Create a file name called `description-generator.js` in the lib folder
3. Add the following code to the `description-generator.js` file to have a working generator function

```js
require("dotenv").config();
const cohere = require("cohere-ai");
cohere.init(process.env.COHERE_API_KEY);

const generator = async ({ product, keywords }) => {
  const response = await cohere.generate({
    model: "xlarge",
    prompt: `Given a product and keywords, this program will generate exciting product descriptions. Here are some examples:\n\nProduct: Monitor\nKeywords: curved, gaming\nExciting Product Description: When it comes to serious gaming, every moment counts. This curved gaming monitor delivers the unprecedented immersion you need to play your best.\n--\nProduct: Surfboard\nKeywords: 6”, matte finish\nExciting Product Description: This 6” surfboard is designed for fun. It\'s a board that almost anyone can pick up, ride, and get psyched on.\n--\nProduct: ${product}\nKeywords: ${keywords}\nExciting Product Description:`,
    max_tokens: 50,
    temperature: 0.8,
    k: 0,
    p: 1,
    frequency_penalty: 0,
    presence_penalty: 0,
    stop_sequences: ["--"],
    return_likelihoods: "NONE",
  });
  return response.body.generations[0].text;
};
module.exports = generator;
```

### Use the generator function in the POST route

Update the `description.js` file with the following code to use the generator function in the POST route

```js
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();
const generator = require("../lib/description-generator");

router.post("/", async (req, res) => {
  const { product, keywords } = req.body;
  const description = await generator({ product, keywords });
  res.send(description.slice(0, -3));
});

module.exports = router;
```

### Run the project locally and test it with Postman or Insomnia or whatever you prefer :)

  Send a Post request to [localhost:3000/description](localhost:3000/description) with these keys, `product` and `keywords`

  ```json
  {
    "product": "LG Gamin monitor",
    "keywords": "curved, gaming, 120hz, 4k"
  }
  ```
