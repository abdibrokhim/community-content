## Why should I care about SEO?

This article is a continuation of weekly marketing tutorials on how to improve your marketing with help of AI. Check out our first tutorial on [how to use ChatGPT](https://lablab.ai/t/chatgpt-tutorial-how-to-use-chatgpt-to-create-your-marketing-strategy) for marketing!

In today's digital environment, AI and SEO are becoming necessary tools for organizations to expand and maintain their competitiveness. The technique of enhancing web content to rank higher in search engine results is known as SEO, or search engine optimization. Businesses may boost their exposure, attract more organic traffic to their website, and eventually expand their business by optimizing content to satisfy the requirements of search engines.

Artificial intelligence, or AI, is the process of using technology to build smart computers that can think and act like people. AI may be used to automate processes, analyze data, and give marketers insights. By assisting marketers in optimizing content for search engine algorithms, AI can also be utilized to boost SEO.

AI and SEO are two effective instruments that can support the expansion and success of enterprises. Businesses may take advantage of these tools to boost exposure and improve organic traffic to their websites by utilizing SEO to optimize content and AI to automate processes, optimize data, and deliver insights. Businesses may utilize SEO and AI to get a competitive edge and establish a strong online presence by employing the proper strategy.


## Text to text in marketing

In order for a marketing strategy to be effective, content is essential. In addition to helping your website or app rank higher in search engine results, it is one of the most effective strategies for reaching and engaging with potential customers. Traditionally, content has been created for human readers, but with the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and search engine optimization (SEO), it is now crucial to provide information for bots as well.

In the past, most SEO material was keyword-based, which meant that it was prepared with a certain set of keywords in mind in order to perform better in search engine rankings. But reading this kind of material was frequently tedious and challenging. Content can now be more fascinating and engaging while still being optimized for search engines thanks to the advancement of language models and AI.

Language models are algorithms that are used to produce text, and they have advanced over time. The most sophisticated language models can currently produce text that resembles human-written text almost exactly. This implies that both people and bots can benefit from the content's optimization. Since AI-generated text always follows the same structure, it is also more dependable and simpler to optimize for SEO.

AI can also be used to create text that is customized to the preferences of a certain audience. AI-generated text, for instance, can be used to produce material that is geared toward a particular demographic or geographical region or that is optimized for a particular keyword or combination of keywords. This raises the likelihood of ranking higher in search engine results and helps to guarantee that the material is pertinent to the target audience.

Additionally, customized content for each user can be created using text produced by AI. This may involve making suggestions for goods or services, or creating messages specifically for the user based on their interests. This kind of tailored information can promote client trust, which increases engagement and loyalty.

In general, content that is optimized for both people and bots can be produced using AI-generated text. This can assist in making sure that material is interesting, pertinent, and SEO-optimized. Additionally, customized content for each user can be created using AI-generated text, which may boost user engagement and loyalty.

## Showcase

Together, AI and SEO can produce content that is more useful to businesses. We'll take a step-by-step look at how to use ChatGPT to produce material that is search engine optimized.

Finding a theme and an idea for the post is the first step in the process. This entails conducting research and identifying the key words pertinent to the industry. To make sure that the material can be found in search engine results, it is crucial to identify the appropriate keywords that will be utilized in the post.

The second stage is to draft an article plan and outline. This entails organizing the content and deconstructing the article's distinct components.This will make it easier to read and ensure that the content is well-organized.

The material will be created using AI in the third step. The proper keywords and phrases that are targeted for search engines can be used to create content using AI algorithms. Search engine-friendly web pages and blog entries can be made using this content.

The information is rewritten in the fourth phase to make it easier to read by people. Rewriting the material to increase its interest and engagement is part of this process. This will increase the likelihood that the information will be read and spread.

### 1. Preparation

We will continue the showcase from the previous article, so we will write a SEO article for Content Mastery Academy. But before we find the topic and title for our blog post, we need to first find the most important SEO phrases for our business (if you know them already, you can skip this part, but maybe you want to ask [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) to get inspired?).
