## Introduction

Participating in hackathons offers an exhilarating opportunity to learn, collaborate, and potentially win prizes. These events immerse you in a whirlwind of innovation, where you develop and showcase your projects in a short span of time. While the rush to create a winning product demo is intense, it's crucial not to overlook the importance of securityâ€”especially when it comes to protecting sensitive data like your API key.

As you embark on your hackathon journey, envision creating a solution that can change the game. Whether you're building a cutting-edge app, a groundbreaking platform, or a transformative service, your product demo is the first glimpse into your idea's potential. However, the excitement of sharing your creation shouldn't overshadow the need to safeguard your API key from prying eyes. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of securing your API key in your demo project, ensuring your efforts remain protected and focused on innovation.


## Understanding the Risk: Why API Key Security Matters

**Imagine:** you've put countless hours into crafting a demo that utilizes an API to enhance its functionality. This API, powered by an API key, is the bridge connecting your project to a powerful external resource. But if your API key falls into the wrong hands, your vision could be derailed before it even gets off the ground.

Hackathons are exciting breeding grounds for talent, ideas, and networking opportunities. However, they're also environments where security vulnerabilities can be exploited. Failing to safeguard your API key exposes you to risks such as:

### Data Breaches and Misuse

Unprotected API keys can be easily exploited, allowing malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or manipulate your demo's functionality for their gain.

### Reputation Damage

A security breach can tarnish your reputation as a developer and compromise the trust you've built with potential users, mentors, and collaborators.

### Idea Theft

In the competitive arena of hackathons, an unprotected API key can enable others to replicate or steal your innovative ideas and integrate them into their own projects.

### Financial Implications

If your API key is misused to access premium services, you could be held responsible for unexpected expenses, disrupting your project's budget.


## Let's get started

First thing first. Open Visual Studio Code and click `Clone Repository`.

Then, paste the repository URL [PaLM2 Tutorial](https://github.com/abdibrokhim/PaLM2-Tutorial) and hit `Enter`.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository using the command line. Open your terminal and run the following command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdibrokhim/PaLM2-Tutorial
```

Then, go to the directory.

```bash
cd PaLM2-Tutorial
```

After, successfully cloning the repository open `app.py` file. Here you should see the following lines of code.

```bash 
with st.sidebar:
    palm_api_key = st.text_input('PaLM API Key', key='palm_api_key')
```

What `st.sidebar` actually does? It creates a sidebar in the web app with input field, where everyone can input their own PaLM API key. 
It's a good practice to protect your API key in the demo product in the hackathons. You can see the sidebar in the following image.

Create a file named `.env` in your project's root directory and add:

```bash
palm_api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
```

In your `app.py` file, add:

```bash
import os
palm_api_key = os.getenv('palm_api_key')
```
This way, you're retrieving the API key from a secure environment variable.

To prevent your `.env` file from being pushed to your GitHub repository, create a file named `.gitignore` in your project's root directory and add:

```bash
.env
```

**Conclusion: A Secure Path to Hackathon Success**

In this tutorial, you've mastered the art of protecting your API key in hackathon demo projects. Your journey through the hackathon landscape is not just about innovation; it's about taking a comprehensive approach that includes security from the start. By safeguarding your API key, you're ensuring the integrity of your project, your reputation, and your hard work. As you venture forward, remember that while creativity is key, security is the lock that keeps your ideas safe.
