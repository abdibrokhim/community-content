![An Interactive DALL-E 2 Stream](https://imagedelivery.net/K11gkZF3xaVyYzFESMdWIQ/ec71b5eb-ae0f-4c0a-d1fe-06f120ed9600/full)

**Come and join us for a fun stream where we'll be using the DALL-E 2! DALL-E 2 is a deep learning algorithm that can generate images from textual descriptions
by OpenAI.** It uses a 12-billion parameter training version of the GPT-3 transformer model to interpret the natural language inputs and generate corresponding
images. It'll be interactive, and viewers will suggest prompts in the chat. And we'll be holding a lottery during the stream where three lucky people will be able
to get the generated image for themselves!
