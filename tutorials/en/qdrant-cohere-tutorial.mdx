## What will we do?

<Img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/lablab-static-eu/images/tutorials/ship.png" />

In this tutorial we will utilize Qdrant Vector Database to store Embeddings from Cohere's model and search using cosine similarity. We will use [Cohere](https://lablab.ai/tech/cohere) SDK to access the model. So, without any further ado, letâ€™s jump in!

### Prerequisites

I will use Qdrant Cloud to host my Database. And good to know, that Qdrant provides 1 GB of free forever memory. So go and use Qdrant Cloud. You can find out how to do it [here](https://lablab.ai/t/question-and-answer-on-your-data-with-qdrant#is-qdrant-worth-using).

Now let's create a new virtual environment inside project directory and install the required packages:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

pip install cohere qdrant-client python-dotenv
```

Please create a project `.py` file.

### Data

<Img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/lablab-static-eu/images/tutorials/eagle.png" />

We will store our data in JSON format. Feel free to copy it:

```json

  { "key": "Lion", "desc": "Majestic big cat with golden fur and a loud roar." },
  { "key": "Penguin", "desc": "Flightless bird with a tuxedo-like black and white coat." },
  { "key": "Gorilla", "desc": "Intelligent primate with muscular build and gentle nature." },
  { "key": "Elephant", "desc": "Large mammal with a long trunk and gray skin." },
  { "key": "Koala", "desc": "Cute and cuddly marsupial with fluffy ears and a big nose." },

]
```

### Environment variables

Create `.env` file and store your Cohere API key, Qdrant API key and Qdrant host there:

```bash
QDRANT_API_KEY=<qdrant-api-keu>
QDRANT_HOST=<qdrant-host>
COHERE_API_KEY=<cohere-api-key>
```

### Importing libraries

```python
import json
import os
import uuid
from typing import Dict, List

import cohere
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from qdrant_client.http import models
```

### Load Environment variables

```python

load_dotenv()

QDRANT_API_KEY = os.getenv("QDRANT_API_KEY")
QDRANT_HOST = os.getenv("QDRANT_HOST")
COHERE_API_KEY = os.getenv("COHERE_API_KEY")

COHERE_SIZE_VECTOR = 4096  # Larger model

if not QDRANT_API_KEY:
    raise ValueError("QDRANT_API_KEY is not set")

if not QDRANT_HOST:
    raise ValueError("QDRANT_HOST is not set")

if not COHERE_API_KEY:
    raise ValueError("COHERE_API_KEY is not set")
```

### How to index data and search throught it later?

I will implement the `SearchClient` class, which will be able to index and access our data. Class will contain all necessary functionalities, such as indexing and searching, but also data conversion to necessary formats.

```python
class SearchClient:
    def __init__(
        self,
        qdrabt_api_key: str = QDRANT_API_KEY,
        qdrant_host: str = QDRANT_HOST,
        cohere_api_key: str = COHERE_API_KEY,
        collection_name: str = "animal",
    ):
        self.qdrant_client = QdrantClient(host=qdrant_host, api_key=qdrabt_api_key)
        self.collection_name = collection_name

        self.qdrant_client.recreate_collection(
            collection_name=self.collection_name,
            vectors_config=models.VectorParams(
                size=COHERE_SIZE_VECTOR, distance=models.Distance.COSINE
            ),
        )

        self.co_client = cohere.Client(api_key=cohere_api_key)

    # Qdrant requires data in float format
    def _float_vector(self, vector: List[float]):
        return list(map(float, vector))

    # Embedding using Cohere Embed model
    def _embed(self, text: str):
        return self.co_client.embed(texts=[text]).embeddings[0]

    # Prepare Qdrant Points
    def _qdrant_format(self, data: List[Dict[str, str]]):
        points = [
            models.PointStruct(
                id=uuid.uuid4().hex,
                payload={"key": point["key"], "desc": point["desc"]},
                vector=self._float_vector(self._embed(point["desc"])),
            )
            for point in data
        ]

        return points

    # Index data
    def index(self, data: List[Dict[str, str]]):
        """
        data: list of dict with keys: "key" and "desc"
        """

        points = self._qdrant_format(data)

        result = self.qdrant_client.upsert(
            collection_name=self.collection_name, points=points
        )

        return result

    # Search using text query
    def search(self, query_text: str, limit: int = 3):
        query_vector = self._embed(query_text)

        return self.qdrant_client.search(
            collection_name=self.collection_name,
            query_vector=self._float_vector(query_vector),
            limit=limit,
        )
```

### Let's use our code!

Let's try to read data from the `data.json` file, process and index it. Then we can try to search and get top 3 results from our Database!

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    client = SearchClient()

    # import data from data.json file
    with open("data.json", "r") as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    index_result = client.index(data)
    print(index_result)

    print("====")

    search_result = client.search(
        "Tallest animal in the world, quite long neck.",
    )

    print(search_result)
```

### RESULTS!

```bash
operation_id=0 status=<UpdateStatus.COMPLETED: 'completed'>

===

[ScoredPoint(id='d17eb61c-8764-4bdb-bb26-ac66c3ffa220', version=0, score=0.8677041, payload={'desc': 'Tallest land animal with a long neck and spots on its fur.', 'key': 'Giraffe'}, vector=None), ScoredPoint(id='4934a842-8c55-42bc-938f-a839be2505de', version=0, score=0.71296465, payload={'desc': 'Large, semi-aquatic mammal with a wide mouth and stubby legs.', 'key': 'Hippopotamus'}, vector=None), ScoredPoint(id='05d7e73c-a8bf-44f9-a8b4-af82e06719d0', version=0, score=0.69240415, payload={'desc': 'Large, thick-skinned mammal with a horn on its nose.', 'key': 'Rhino'}, vector=None)]
```

As you can see in 1st row: index operation went well. We got 3 results, as we defined.
The 1st one is (as expected) a Giraffe. We also got Hippopotamus and Rhino. They are also huge, but I think Giraffe is the tallest ðŸ˜†.
