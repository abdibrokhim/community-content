In this tutorial we'll build a Nextjs app that uses Cohere to classify news headlines. We'll 
use the Cohere API to classify news headlines and display the results in a Nextjs app.

## What is Cohere?

Cohere is a machine learning API that can classify text categories (and much more). It's 
a great way to add machine learning to your app without having to build your own models.

## What is Nextjs?

Nextjs is a React framework that makes it easy to build server-rendered React apps. It's
great for building static sites and web apps.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need:

- A Cohere account. You can sign up for free at [cohere.ai](https://cohere.ai).
- A Nextjs app. You can create one with `npx create-next-app`.

## Build the user interface

First, we'll build the user interface for our app. in our `index.js` file, we'll add a
`textarea` and a `button` to press. 

```jsx
const [text, setText] = useState("");

return (
  <div className="flex flex-col h-screen  items-center">
    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline">
      Cohere Headline classifier
    </h1>
    <p className="py-4">Enter headline here</p>
    <textarea
      onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
      className="block p-2.5 w-1/2 text-sm text-gray-900 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg border 
      border-gray-300 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:border-blue-500 dark:bg-gray-700 
      dark:border-gray-600 dark:placeholder-gray-400 dark:text-white 
      dark:focus:ring-blue-500 dark:focus:border-blue-500"
    ></textarea>
    <button
      onClick={classify}
      className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold my-4 p-4 rounded"
    >
      Classify
    </button>
    <p>Classification:</p>
    <pre>{JSON.stringify(classification, null, 2)}</pre>
  </div>
)
```
This will give us a simple UI to enter a headline and press a button to classify it, that 
looks like this:

## Classify the text

Les build the classify function. First import the cohere client & add you API key. You can 
find your API key on your [dashboard](https://dashboard.cohere.ai/).

```
const cohere = require("cohere-ai");
cohere.init("YOUR-API-KEY");
```

```js
const [classification, setClassification] = useState("");

  const classify = async () => {
    text == "" && alert("Please enter some text");
    const response = await cohere.classify({
      model: "large",
      inputs: [text],
      examples: [
        {
          text: "New Era Begins at Warner Bros. Tinged with Nostalgia",
          label: "Technology",
        },
        {
          text: "As Gas Prices Went Up, So Did the Hunt for Electric Vehicles",
          label: "Technology",
        },
        { text: "Facial Recognition Goes to War", label: "Technology" },
        {
          text: "US Says It Secretly Removed Malware Worldwide",
          label: "Technology",
        },
        { text: "The Old-Timers Are Chasing Netflix", label: "Technology" },
        {
          text: "Few Cars, Lots of Customers: Why Autos Are an Inflation Risk",
          label: "Economy",
        },
        {
          text: "Supply Chains Widely Tainted by Forced Labour in China",
          label: "Economy",
        },
        {
          text: "The US Economy is Booming. Why are Economists Worrying About a Recession?",
          label: "Economy",
        },
        {
          text: "Industries hit hard by the pandemic continued their rebound",
          label: "Economy",
        },
        {
          text: "Energy prices in Europe soar 45 percent as inflation hits another record",
          label: "Economy",
        },
        {
          text: "New Drug Slashed Deaths Among Patients With Severe Covid, Maker Claims",
          label: "Health",
        },
        { text: "Is 30 minutes of Exercise a Day Enough?", label: "Health" },
        {
          text: "With a $2.1 Million Cure Their Only Hope, Parents Plead for Help Online",
          label: "Health",
        },
        {
          text: "The FDA suspends use of a Glaxo antibody drug in the US as an Omnicron subvariant spreads",
          label: "Health",
        },
        { text: "What to know about the Bird Flu Outbreak", label: "Health" },
      ],
    });
    setClassification(response.body.classifications);
  };
```

As you can see here, we have to add some examples to the `classify` function. We can add as many
examples as we want. The more examples we add, the more accurate the classification will be.
Then we can add the text from the `textarea` to the `inputs` array. The `model` parameter is the
size of the model we want to use. We will use `large`. The larger the model, the more accurate the
classification will be, but the slower it will be. The `large` model is a good balance between
accuracy and speed.

## Deploy to Vercel

Now that we have a working app, we can deploy it to Vercel. Vercel is a great way to deploy
Nextjs apps. It has a free tier and easy to use. Upload your project to GitHub and connect it
on Vercel.com.
