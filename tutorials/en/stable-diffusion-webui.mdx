Have you ever wondered how an animated version of yourself might look? With [Stable Diffusion](https://lablab.ai/tech/stable-diffusion), you don’t need to wonder anymore, instead you can create a Disney Pixar style avatar of yourself using some simple text input. If you are new to Stable Diffusion have a look at this tutorial and explanation [here](https://lablab.ai/t/stable-diffusion-img2img)

In this tutorial we are going to walk you through the steps to create a Pixar style animated avatar of yourself. 

## Getting started with Stable Diffusion

Before we start there are a few basic requirements; which we will list below:
+ Nvidia GPU with at least 4GB of VRAM
+ Stable Diffusion Web UI – Download from [Github](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)
+ Stable Diffusion 1.5 [checkpoint file](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5#:~:text=v1%2D5%2Dpruned%2Demaonly.ckpt%20%2D%204.27GB%2C%20ema%2Donly%20weight.%20uses%20less%20VRAM%20%2D%20suitable%20for%20inference)
+ A portrait of yourself or any other image to use

## Setting up the environment

Below are the steps to setup your local environment for the project:

### Step 1: Extract Stable Diffusion Project
The Stable Diffusion Web UI project should be downloaded to your local disk. You can either clone the Github repository, or download the project as a ZIP file and unzip that into a folder on your local disk.
Your file and folder list should like the image below:

### Step 2: Stable Diffusion Checkpoint file
Next, we have to move the stable diffusion checkpioint file, which we downloaded from Hugging face into the **models\stable-diffusion folder**:

Once the file is copied into the models\stable-diffusion folder you must rename it to **model.chkpt**, as shown in the screenshots below:

### Step 3: Running the WebUI
Now that we’ve completed the steps above, we are ready to launch the stable diffusion Web UI. We can do this by running the “webui-user.bat” in the stable diffusion project folder, as shown in the image below:

<Img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/lablab-static-eu/images/tutorials/stable-diff-41.png" />

But, before we can do that we have to modify the “webui-user.bat” file to reference our local Python installation. You can edit the “webui-user.bat” file with an editor of your choice, Notepad will also work. The contents of the “webui-user.bat” will look similar to the lines below;


```
@echo off

set PYTHON="C:\Users\LENOVO\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe"
set GIT=
set VENV_DIR=
set COMMANDLINE_ARGS=

call webui.bat
```

Now that we are all set up with the “webui-user.bat” file we can double-click the file to run it!

Open your Chrome browser and navigate to the following URL http://127.0.0.1:7860 which will launch the Gradio UI. The screen will look something like the image below;

Next we can start playing around with the image-to-image generations.

### Step 4: Generating the image
Under the “img2img” tab, drag and drop a photo of your choice, and adjust the settings that will suit your PC hardware. If you have a good graphics card, like an NVidia RTX3060 with sufficient VRAM, you can push the resolution higher, up to at least 1024x1024.

If you are using a picture of yourself, you can try the following text input prompt;

Pixar, Disney character, 3D render, high quality, smooth render, a girl wearing glasses, black T-shirt, cute smile

Also, remember that the CFG (Classifier Free Guidance) scale and Denoising strength have a significant effect on the final results. Here are a few tips for adjusting the settings to improve the results:

+ Increasing the Denoising value creates a result that looks less like your original image
+ The higher the CFG scale, the stricter the Stable Diffusion is instructed to follow the instructions of your prompt, although it does lead to a few anomalies.

For this example, I discovered that the most appropriate value for Denoise strength parameter to be **0.7** and the CFG scale of **11.0**. The image below is the final result compared to the original photo.

And that all there is to creating a Disney Pixar styled avatar of yourself, using Stable Diffusion! I encourage you to play around with the settings and use different reference images to see what results you end up with. 

I hope you have as much fun creating new and creative images as I did!
