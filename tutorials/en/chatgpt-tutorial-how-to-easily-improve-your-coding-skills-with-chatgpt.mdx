## What is ChatGPT?

A natural language processing (NLP) system called ChatGPT, which uses the OpenAI [GPT-3 language model](https://lablab.ai/tech/openai/gpt3), enables users to design unique conversations for chatbot software. It helps users to construct more natural conversational experiences and automate chores like customer service enquiries and commonly asked questions. This can help you do your job better by enabling more effective task completion and giving consumers more organic interactions with your chatbot application. Users can further tailor their discussions with the AI-powered chatbot using ChatGPT in order to better meet their needs and tastes. By giving users a better and more tailored experience, this can ultimately increase customer satisfaction rates.

## General programming questions

As a programmer you probably have one main language you work with. From time to time you also get in contact with other languages or known frameworks. This is where ChatGPT is by your side to clarify questions, for example “What is Python good for” or “What kind of Software gets developed with C++”. This can save you valuable time, because you don't have to research these topics online by yourself. So ChatGPT can really help you with general programming and computer science knowledge within seconds. It can also offer insights into the benefits and drawbacks of various coding languages, the best methods for resolving coding problems, and the best procedures for software development. You may learn how to use various frameworks, libraries, and APIs with the aid of ChatGPT. It can also offer advice on how to optimize your code for optimum performance. You may quickly and easily access a plethora of programming and computer science knowledge using ChatGPT. Or you can as well visit [other ChatGPT tutorials](https://lablab.ai/tech/openai/chatgpt#tutorials) on lablab.ai. So, let’s go to the showcases:

### Code generation 

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) can generate code quickly and with a high degree of accuracy. By providing ChatGPT with a code template and a set of instructions, it can generate new code that is tailored to your specific needs. This can be a great way to speed up your development process and learn new coding techniques.

For example if we need to make a function that gathers data from an array and we forgot how to do it.

<Img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/lablab-static-eu/images/tutorials/array.PNG"/>

Let’s ask ChatGPT to get all the professions in an array

I tested the function and it is correct. ChatGPT is even saying at the end that we can even do this function with a filter method.
Let’s ask ChatGPT to create the function with the filter method.

So in the second function first we are checking if the object has a profession property.
Interesting choice. I was asking ChatGPT what is the performance difference between the two functions.

<Img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/lablab-static-eu/images/tutorials/ink%20(2).png"/>

I prefer the second function as it will not return undefined in case of no profession. I would like to know of course what ChatGPT favors.

So now we know exactly what is the difference between the two functions.
If we are not sure about some coding function we can always ask ChatGPT ;)

### Code completion

By recommending the following logical line of code to write based on the present context, ChatGPT can also help with code completion. Learning about various functions, techniques, and other programming components can be done so quite effectively. You can have a discussion on the code once a completion has been generated. Make careful to clarify specifics such as the goal of the code, the desired result, and any pertinent implementation details by asking questions. You can also utilize the chatbot to give feedback and recommendations on the code, which can aid you in understanding any errors or potential enhancements. You can learn more about coding methods and boost your confidence in your coding skills by participating in this interactive debate. And if you’re looking for [ChatGPT API](https://lablab.ai/tech/openai/chatgpt) or libraries, we gathered them on lablab.ai tech page.

### Code documentation

ChatGPT can assist you in writing clear and concise documentation for your code. By providing the model with information about your code, it can generate detailed documentation that explains how your code works and how to use it.
Troubleshooting: ChatGPT can help you troubleshoot code errors by analyzing your code and suggesting potential solutions to the problem.

It's worth noting that while ChatGPT can be a useful tool for improving your coding skills, it's not a substitute for hands-on practice and experience. It's important to use ChatGPT as a supplement to your existing coding practice, not a replacement. 

<Img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/lablab-static-eu/images/tutorials/ink%20(5).png"/>

As you can see here, ChatGPT understands this algorithm and it's able to fill in a comment on each line. This works especially well for generic code like algorithms. It's important to say that ChatGPT needs enough context to be able to write documentation for your code. Sometimes it will even ask you for more information before giving you a response. 
You can also check our previous tutorial on [how to make a website with ChatGPT](https://lablab.ai/t/chatgpt-tutorial-how-to-create-a-website-with-chatgpt), if you want to know more before you give it a first spin.

## So… should I use ChatGPT in everyday programming?

It is entirely up to you, but it is unquestionably quicker to tell ChatGPT what you need and then check the code than it is to manually write everything from scratch. Additionally, the technology from OpenAI can be used to learn new coding languages or functionalities. This might be a priceless tool for individuals who are just getting started and require assistance with a coding issue. By avoiding the need to engage an experienced programmer to assist you, it's also a terrific method to save time and money. I would urge to treat it as a personal assistant, who will answer more accurately all of your queries and save you time by not having to seek for them. 
By doing so, you may avoid wasting time seeking for answers and instead concentrate on writing the code correctly and making sure it works as intended.
