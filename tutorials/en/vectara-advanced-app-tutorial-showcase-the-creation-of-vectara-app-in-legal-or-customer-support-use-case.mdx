### üèóÔ∏è Concept and Architecture: Your Customized Chatbot Agency

Let's picture ourselves as young entrepreneurs kick-starting a chatbot agency. Shying away from the costly plans of no-code tools like Botpress, and yearning for a higher degree of customization, we find solace in Vectara's ecosystem.

#### Knowledge Base: The CORPUS

Our journey begins with crafting our knowledge base, dubbed as CORPUS in Vectara's realm. Envision each corpus as a personalized library, a repository where multiple documents find their abode. This becomes indispensable for a business owner or a budding entrepreneur in the chatbot realm. The essence is to avert the tedious re-training and re-configuration of the system with every new client project. A centralized knowledge system acts as a reservoir of wisdom, enabling the bot to fetch apt responses swiftly and accurately.

#### Vectara‚Äôs Indexing and Querying APIs: The Navigators

When an end-user sends a query, Vectara‚Äôs state-of-the-art indexing and querying APIs spring into action. They ingest the data, embed it, and whisk through the corpus to fetch the most apropos response. This data is then fed to a summarizer, adding a human touch to the output, thus evading the robotic undertone often associated with bot responses.

#### Implementation with Streamlit: The Playground

To breathe life into our concept, we‚Äôll employ Streamlit which not only unveils the inner workings of the code but provides a playground to test and iterate quickly. As we advance, a treasure trove of Vectara libraries awaits the backend developers, promising a smoother sail even if centering that div seems like chasing the horizon!

#### A Dash of Humor: The Artistic Struggle

Oh, and about the artistic struggle with centering divs, fear not! While art may have its Mona Lisa, in the coding world, a perfectly centered div is no less of a masterpiece! (And just like me, it seems Vectara too, isn‚Äôt too fond of going off-center!)

### Why Use Both API-Key and OAuth?
Vectara's platform employs two different authentication methods: OAuth for indexing and API-keys for searching. This dual approach balances ease of use with robust security measures.

OAuth is specifically leveraged for indexing because it's well-suited for server-to-server communications, where operations require higher security due to the changing nature of data. It is a protocol that allows for secure authorization in a simple and standard method from web, mobile, and desktop applications. Therefore, for any operation that modifies data, like indexing, OAuth provides an additional layer of security by enabling token-based authentication and authorization.

On the other hand, API-keys are used for search operations as they offer a simpler method of access control that can be managed easily within an application. Searches often do not require the same level of security as indexing since they typically do not involve altering data.

While indexing can also be performed with an API-key, using OAuth is a best practice for actions that could affect the integrity of your data. Vectara thus offers flexibility, allowing users to choose the most appropriate authentication method for their specific needs.

By understanding and implementing both authentication methods as recommended, you ensure that your application interacts with Vectara's services in a secure and efficient manner, adhering to best practices for API usage.

## **Exploring Vectara.py: A Deep Dive into the Code** üñ•Ô∏è

In this section, we'll meticulously dissect `Vectara.py`, our backbone script that bridges our application with Vectara's platform. Our aim is to unearth the essence of each function, why certain methods were employed, and how they contribute to the overall functionality of our Customer Support application. So, let‚Äôs roll up our sleeves and dive into the code!

### **1. Setting the Stage: Importing Necessary Libraries** üìö

```python
import json
import logging
import mimetypes
import os
from typing import Tuple

import requests
from authlib.integrations.requests_client import OAuth2Session
from dotenv import load_dotenv
```

The first step is importing the necessary libraries. Libraries like `requests` and `OAuth2Session` from `authlib` are fundamental for handling HTTP requests and OAuth2 authentication respectively, which are critical when communicating with Vectara's APIs. We also import `dotenv` to load environment variables from a `.env` file, ensuring a secure and organized way to handle configurations.

### **2. Preparing the Environment** üåø

```python
# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()
```
By invoking `load_dotenv()`, we ensure that our script has access to crucial environment variables stored in a `.env` file. This not only enhances security but also promotes code reusability across different environments.

### **3. Unveiling the Indexing Class** üóÇÔ∏è

```python
class Indexing:
    def __init__(self):
        self.auth_url = os.getenv('AUTH_URL')
        self.app_client_id = os.getenv('APP_CLIENT_ID')
        self.app_client_secret = os.getenv('APP_CLIENT_SECRET')
        self.jwt_token = self._get_jwt_token()
        ...
```
The `Indexing` class is where the magic of data ingestion and indexing happens. Its methods are crafted to interact with Vectara's indexing API, laying down the tracks for our data to travel from our local environment to Vectara's corpus.

#### **Securing Access with JWT Token** üîê

```python
    def _get_jwt_token(self) -> str:
        """Connect to the server and get a JWT token."""
        token_endpoint = f"{self.auth_url}/oauth2/token"
        session = OAuth2Session(self.app_client_id, self.app_client_secret, scope="")
        token = session.fetch_token(token_endpoint, grant_type="client_credentials")
        return token["access_token"]
        ...
```
In `_get_jwt_token`, we initiate an OAuth2 session to obtain a JWT token, which is indispensable for authenticating our requests to Vectara's API.

#### **Uploading Documents to the Corpus** üì§

```python
    def upload_file(self, customer_id: int, corpus_id: int, idx_address: str, uploaded_file, file_title: str) -> Tuple[requests.Response, bool]:
            """Uploads a file to the corpus."""
            # Determine the MIME type based on the file extension
            extension_to_mime_type = {
                '.txt': 'text/plain',
                '.pdf': 'application/pdf',
                '.doc': 'application/msword',
                '.docx': 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document',
                # ... add more mappings as needed
            }
            file_extension = os.path.splitext(uploaded_file.name)[-1]
            mime_type = extension_to_mime_type.get(file_extension, 'application/octet-stream')

            post_headers = {
                "Authorization": f"Bearer {self.jwt_token}"
            }
            
            try:
                file = uploaded_file.read()  
                files = {"file": (file_title, file, mime_type)}
                response = requests.post(
                    f"https://{idx_address}/v1/upload?c={customer_id}&o={corpus_id}",
                    files=files,
                    headers=post_headers
                )
            
                if response.status_code != 200:
                    logging.error("REST upload failed with code %d, reason %s, text %s",
                                response.status_code,
                                response.reason,
                                response.text)
                    return response, False
                return response, True
            except Exception as e:
                logging.error("An error occurred while uploading the file: %s", str(e))
                return None, False
 
        ...
```

The `upload_file` method is our gateway to send documents to Vectara's corpus. It's designed to handle the file upload, ensuring the document finds its place in the corpus for later retrieval.

##### **Automated MIME Type Detection** üîç

```python
        # Determine the MIME type based on the file extension
        extension_to_mime_type = {
            '.txt': 'text/plain',
            '.pdf': 'application/pdf',
            '.doc': 'application/msword',
            '.docx': 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document',
            # ... add more mappings as needed
        }
        file_extension = os.path.splitext(uploaded_file.name)[-1]
        mime_type = extension_to_mime_type.get(file_extension, 'application/octet-stream')
```

In the snippet above, we manually map file extensions to their respective MIME types. This is crucial for the Vectara platform to understand the nature of the file and process it accordingly. However, it's worth noting that the `mimetypes` library could also be used to dynamically determine the MIME type of the file being uploaded, as shown below:

```python
        mime_type = mimetypes.guess_type(uploaded_file.name)[0] or 'application/octet-stream'
```

### **4. The Searching Class: A Quest for Answers** üîç

```python
class Searching:
    def __init__(self):
        self.customer_id = os.getenv('CUSTOMER_ID')
        self.api_key = os.getenv('API_KEY')
        ...
```
`Searching` class is our crafted toolset for querying Vectara's corpus. It encapsulates the logic needed to formulate and send queries, and to process the received responses.

#### **Sending Queries to Vectara** üì©

```python
    def send_query(self, corpus_id, query_text, num_results, summarizer_prompt_name, response_lang, max_summarized_results):
        api_key_header = {
            "customer-id": self.customer_id,
            "x-api-key": self.api_key,
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }

        data_dict = {
            "query": [
                {
                    "query": query_text,
                    "num_results": num_results,
                    "corpus_key": [{"customer_id": self.customer_id, "corpus_id": corpus_id}],
                    'summary': [
                        {
                            'summarizerPromptName': summarizer_prompt_name,
                            'responseLang': response_lang,
                            'maxSummarizedResults': max_summarized_results
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }

        payload = json.dumps(data_dict)

        response = requests.post(
            "https://api.vectara.io/v1/query",
            data=payload,
            verify=True,
            headers=api_key_header
        )

        if response.status_code == 200:
            print("Request was successful!")
            data = response.json()
            texts = [item['text'] for item in data['responseSet'][0]['response'] if 'text' in item]
            return texts
        else:
            print("Request failed with status code:", response.status_code)
            print("Response:", response.text)
            return None
        ...
```
In `send_query`, we assemble our query, package it in the required format, and send it off to Vectara's query API. The method is a symphony of parameters coming together to form a query, ensuring that the Vectara platform receives our quest for information in a format it understands.

### **Dissecting `app.py`**

`app.py` stands as the fa√ßade of our application, portraying a user-friendly interface for indexing and searching documents within the Vectara platform. This script leverages Streamlit, a fast, interactive, and browser-based app framework to weave together a seamless user experience. Here‚Äôs a detailed walkthrough of the significant segments within `app.py`.

#### **1. Import Section & Initialization**

```python
import os
import streamlit as st
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from Vectara import Indexing, Searching  

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Create instances of Indexing and Searching classes
indexer = Indexing()
searcher = Searching()
```
In this segment:

- Essential libraries are imported: `os` for interacting with the operating system, `streamlit` for crafting the interface, `dotenv` for managing environment variables, and `Indexing` & `Searching` classes from `helpers.py` to handle document indexing and searching functionality.
- `load_dotenv()` is invoked to load environment variables from a `.env` file, which is a safer practice for handling configurations.
- Instances of `Indexing` and `Searching` classes are created, dubbed `indexer` and `searcher` respectively, forming the linchpin between the user interface and the backend logic encapsulated in `helpers.py`.

#### **2. Streamlit Page Configuration**

```python
# Set up the Streamlit interface
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Vectara Retrieval Augmented System",
    layout="wide",
    initial_sidebar_state="expanded"
)

st.title("Vectara Retrieval Augmented Generation")
```

In this juncture:

- `st.set_page_config` method is summoned to set the page title, layout, and the initial state of the sidebar, laying the groundwork for a well-structured and inviting interface.
- `st.title` method is used to display the title of the application at the top of the page.

#### **3. Sidebar Section**

```python
with st.sidebar:
    ...
    st.info("Vectara Retrieval Augmented Generation powered by Streamlit.")
```
Here:

- A sidebar is crafted using `with st.sidebar`, providing a neat space for auxiliary content or actions. 

#### **4. Document Indexing Section**

```python
with st.expander("Index a Document", expanded=True):
    col1, col2 = st.columns([2, 1])
    with col1:
        uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose a document", type=["txt", "pdf", "doc", "docx", "ppt", "pptx", "xls", "xlsx"])
        file_title = st.text_input("File Title", value="Document Title", key='file_title')
    if st.button("Index Document"):
        with st.spinner("Indexing document..."):
            response, success = indexer.upload_file(
            customer_id=int(os.getenv('CUSTOMER_ID')),
            corpus_id=int(os.getenv('CORPUS_ID')),
            idx_address=os.getenv('IDX_ADDRESS'),
            uploaded_file=uploaded_file,
            file_title=file_title
        )
            if success:
                st.success("Document indexed successfully!")
            else:
                st.error("Failed to index document.")
```

In this stretch:

- An expander titled "Index a Document" is created using `st.expander`, which when clicked, unveils the document indexing section.
- `st.columns` method is employed to create a two-column layout.
- `st.file_uploader` and `st.text_input` methods are harnessed to create file upload and text input widgets respectively.
- `st.button` method is used to create a button widget which, when pressed, triggers the indexing process by invoking the `upload_file` method from the `indexer` instance.
- `st.spinner` method displays a spinner animation during the indexing process to indicate activity.
- Success or failure messages are displayed using `st.success` and `st.error` methods respectively based on the outcome of the indexing process.

#### **5. Corpus Searching Section**

```python
with st.expander("Search the Corpus", expanded=True):
    col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)
    with col1:
        query_text = st.text_input("Enter your query", key='query_text')
    with col2:

            else:
                st.error("No results found.")
```

In this segment:

- Another expander titled "Search the Corpus" is created which unveils the corpus searching section when clicked.
- Various input widgets are created for users to input their search query and preferences.
- A "Search" button is created using `st.button`, which triggers the searching process by invoking the `send_query` method from the `searcher` instance.
- A markdown divider and a header are added to separate and title the output section.
- The results from the search query are iterated through and displayed using `st.markdown`, or an error message is displayed if no results are found using `st.error`.



`app.py` efficiently orchestrates the user interaction with the Vectara platform. It's structured to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for users to index and search documents. Through a combination of Streamlit‚Äôs interactive widgets and well-organized code, `app.py` forms a robust and user-friendly interface for the Vectara Retrieval Augmented System.
